AB  - The inherent stochasticity of metabolism raises a critical question for 
      understanding homeostasis: are cellular processes regulated in response to 
      internal fluctuations? Here, we show that, in E. coli cells under constant 
      external conditions, catabolic enzyme expression continuously responds to 
      metabolic fluctuations. The underlying regulatory feedback is enabled by the 
      cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP receptor protein (CRP) system, which controls 
      catabolic enzyme expression based on metabolite concentrations. Using single-cell 
      microscopy, genetic constructs in which this feedback is disabled, and 
      mathematical modeling, we show how fluctuations circulate through the metabolic 
      and genetic network at sub-cell-cycle timescales. Modeling identifies four noise 
      propagation modes, including one specific to CRP regulation. Together, these 
      modes correctly predict noise circulation at perturbed cAMP levels. The cAMP-CRP 
      system may thus have evolved to control internal metabolic fluctuations in 
      addition to external growth conditions. We conjecture that second messengers may 
      more broadly function to achieve cellular homeostasis.

AB  - Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a ubiquitous second messenger synthesized by most living 
      organisms. In bacteria, it plays highly diverse roles in metabolism, host 
      colonization, motility, and many other processes important for optimal fitness. 
      The main route of cAMP perception is through transcription factors from the 
      diverse and versatile CRP-FNR protein superfamily. Since the discovery of the 
      very first CRP protein CAP in Escherichia coli more than four decades ago, its 
      homologs have been characterized in both closely related and distant bacterial 
      species. The cAMP-mediated gene activation for carbon catabolism by a CRP protein 
      in the absence of glucose seems to be restricted to E. coli and its close 
      relatives. In other phyla, the regulatory targets are more diverse. In addition 
      to cAMP, cGMP has recently been identified as a ligand of certain CRP proteins. 
      In a CRP dimer, each of the two cyclic nucleotide molecules makes contacts with 
      both protein subunits and effectuates a conformational change that favors DNA 
      binding. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on structural and physiological 
      aspects of E. coli CAP compared with other cAMP- and cGMP-activated transcription 
      factors, and point to emerging trends in metabolic regulation related to lysine 
      modification and membrane association of CRP proteins.

TI  - Quantitative model for genome-wide cyclic AMP receptor protein binding site 
      identification and characteristic analysis.

AB  - Cyclic AMP receptor proteins (CRPs) are important transcription regulators in 
      many species. The prediction of CRP-binding sites was mainly based on 
      position-weighted matrixes (PWMs). Traditional prediction methods only considered 
      known binding motifs, and their ability to discover inflexible binding patterns 
      was limited. Thus, a novel CRP-binding site prediction model called CRPBSFinder 
      was developed in this research, which combined the hidden Markov model, 
      knowledge-based PWMs and structure-based binding affinity matrixes. We trained 
      this model using validated CRP-binding data from Escherichia coli and evaluated 
      it with computational and experimental methods. The result shows that the model 
      not only can provide higher prediction performance than a classic method but also 
      quantitatively indicates the binding affinity of transcription factor binding 
      sites by prediction scores. The prediction result included not only the most 
      knowns regulated genes but also 1089 novel CRP-regulated genes. The major 
      regulatory roles of CRPs were divided into four classes: carbohydrate metabolism, 
      organic acid metabolism, nitrogen compound metabolism and cellular transport. 
      Several novel functions were also discovered, including heterocycle metabolic and 
      response to stimulus. Based on the functional similarity of homologous CRPs, we 
      applied the model to 35 other species. The prediction tool and the prediction 
      results are online and are available at: https://awi.cuhk.edu.cn/∼CRPBSFinder.

LID - e00067-23
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria have a unique cell surface that can be modified to 
      maintain bacterial fitness in diverse environments. A well-defined example is the 
      modification of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which promotes 
      resistance to polymyxin antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides. In many 
      organisms, such modifications include the addition of the amine-containing 
      constituents 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) and phosphoethanolamine 
      (pEtN). Addition of pEtN is catalyzed by EptA, which uses 
      phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as its substrate donor, resulting in production of 
      diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG is then quickly recycled into glycerophospholipid (GPL) 
      synthesis by the DAG kinase A (DgkA) to produce phosphatidic acid, the major GPL 
      precursor. Previously, we hypothesized that loss of DgkA recycling would be 
      detrimental to the cell when LPS is heavily modified. Instead, we found that DAG 
      accumulation inhibits EptA activity, preventing further degradation of PE, the 
      predominant GPL of the cell. However, DAG inhibition of pEtN addition results in 
      complete loss of polymyxin resistance. Here, we selected for suppressors to find 
      a mechanism of resistance independent of DAG recycling or pEtN modification. 
      Disrupting the gene encoding the adenylate cyclase, cyaA, fully restored 
      antibiotic resistance without restoring DAG recycling or pEtN modification. 
      Supporting this, disruptions of genes that reduce CyaA-derived cAMP formation 
      (e.g., ptsI) or disruption of the cAMP receptor protein, Crp, also restored 
      resistance. We found that loss of the cAMP-CRP regulatory complex was necessary 
      for suppression and that resistance arises from a substantial increase in 
      l-Ara4N-modified LPS, bypassing the need for pEtN modification. IMPORTANCE 
      Gram-negative bacteria can alter the structure of their LPS to promote resistance 
      to cationic antimicrobial peptides, including polymyxin antibiotics. Polymyxins 
      are considered last-resort antibiotics for treatment against multidrug-resistant 
      Gram-negative organisms. Here, we explore how changes in general metabolism and 
      carbon catabolite repression pathways can alter LPS structure and influence 
      polymyxin resistance.

AB  - The active and inactive structures of the Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein 
      (CRP), a model bacterial transcription factor, are compared to generate a 
      paradigm in the cAMP-induced activation of CRP. The resulting paradigm is shown 
      to be consistent with numerous biochemical studies of CRP and CRP*, a group of 
      CRP mutants displaying cAMP-free activity. The cAMP affinity of CRP is dictated 
      by two factors: (i) the effectiveness of the cAMP pocket and (ii) the protein 
      equilibrium of apo-CRP. How these two factors interplay in determining the cAMP 
      affinity and cAMP specificity of CRP and CRP* mutants are discussed. Both the 
      current understanding and knowledge gaps of CRP-DNA interactions are also 
      described. This review ends with a list of several important CRP issues that need 
      to be addressed in the future.

AB  - High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment is one of the most widely accepted 
      non-thermal food processing methods, but HHP-resistance development in pathogenic 
      or spoilage bacteria might compromise the safety and stability of HHP-treated 
      foods. Charting the possible routes and mechanisms of HHP resistance development 
      in foodborne bacteria is therefore essential to anticipate or prevent the 
      appearance of resistant variants. While upregulation of the RpoS-governed general 
      stress response is a well-established route for increased HHP resistance in 
      Escherichia coli, previous work revealed that mutations causing attenuated 
      cAMP/CRP activity or aggregation-prone TnaA variants can evolve to overcome the 
      HHP-hypersensitivity of an E. coli ΔrpoS mutant. In this study, further directed 
      evolution and genetic analysis approaches allowed us to demonstrate that both 
      kinds of mutants tend to co-emerge and compete with each other in E. coli ΔrpoS 
      populations evolving towards HHP resistance, because of the higher HHP resistance 
      of cAMP/CRP mutants and the faster growth rate of the TnaA mutants. Moreover, 
      closer scrutiny of evolving populations revealed RpoS, cAMP/CRP and TnaA 
      independent routes of HHP resistance development, based on downregulation of YegW 
      or RppH activity.

AB  - Attempts to understand gene regulation by global transcription factors have 
      largely been limited to expression studies under binary conditions of presence 
      and absence of the transcription factor. Studies addressing genome-wide 
      transcriptional responses to changing transcription factor concentration at high 
      resolution are lacking. Here, we create a data set containing the entire 
      Escherichia coli transcriptome in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth as it responds to 10 
      different cAMP concentrations spanning the biological range. We use the Hill's 
      model to accurately summarize individual gene responses into three intuitively 
      understandable parameters, E(max), n, and k, reflecting the sensitivity, 
      nonlinearity, and midpoint of the dynamic range. Our data show that most 
      cAMP-regulated genes have an n of >2, with their k values centered around the 
      wild-type concentration of cAMP. Additionally, cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 
      affinity to a promoter is correlated with E(max) but not k, hinting that a 
      high-affinity CRP promoter need not ensure transcriptional activation at lower 
      cAMP concentrations and instead affects the magnitude of the response. Finally, 
      genes belonging to different functional classes are tuned to have different k, n, 
      and E(max) values. We demonstrate that phenomenological models are a better 
      alternative for studying gene expression trends than classical clustering 
      methods, with the phenomenological constants providing greater insights into how 
      genes are tuned in a regulatory network. IMPORTANCE Different genes may follow 
      different trends in response to various transcription factor concentrations. In 
      this study, we ask two questions: (i) what are the trends that different genes 
      follow in response to changing transcription factor concentrations and (ii) what 
      methods can be used to extract information from the gene trends so obtained. We 
      demonstrate a method to analyze transcription factor concentration-dependent 
      genome-wide expression data using phenomenological models. Conventional 
      clustering methods and principal-component analysis (PCA) can be used to 
      summarize trends in data but have limited interpretability. The use of 
      phenomenological models greatly enhances the interpretability and thus utility of 
      conventional clustering. Transformation of dose-response data into 
      phenomenological constants opens up avenues to ask and answer many different 
      kinds of question. We show that the phenomenological constants obtained from the 
      model fits can be used to generate insights about network topology and allows 
      integration of other experimental data such as chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      sequencing (ChIP-seq) to understand the system in greater detail.

AB  - Over half the proteins in the E. coli cytoplasm form homo or hetero-oligomeric 
      structures. Experimentally determined structures are often considered in 
      determining a protein's oligomeric state, but static structures miss the dynamic 
      equilibrium between different quaternary forms. The problem is exacerbated in 
      homo-oligomers, where the oligomeric states are challenging to characterize. 
      Here, we re-evaluated the oligomeric state of 17 different bacterial proteins 
      across a broad range of protein concentrations and solutions by native mass 
      spectrometry (MS), mass photometry (MP), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and 
      small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), finding that most exhibit several oligomeric 
      states. Surprisingly, some proteins did not show mass-action driven equilibrium 
      between the oligomeric states. For approximately half the proteins, the predicted 
      oligomeric forms described in publicly available databases underestimated the 
      complexity of protein quaternary structures in solution. Conversely, AlphaFold 
      multimer provided an accurate description of the potential multimeric states for 
      most proteins, suggesting that it could help resolve uncertainties on the 
      solution state of many proteins.

TI  - Effects of Global and Specific DNA-Binding Proteins on Transcriptional Regulation 
      of the E. coli bgl Operon.
LID - 10.3390/ijms231810343 [doi]
LID - 10343
AB  - Using reporter gene (lacZ) transcriptional fusions, we examined the 
      transcriptional dependencies of the bgl promoter (Pbgl) and the entire operon 
      regulatory region (Pbgl-bglG) on eight transcription factors as well as the 
      inducer, salicin, and an IS5 insertion upstream of Pbgl. Crp-cAMP is the primary 
      activator of both Pbgl and the bgl operon, while H-NS is a strong dominant operon 
      repressor but only a weak repressor of Pbgl. H-NS may exert its repressive effect 
      by looping the DNA at two binding sites. StpA is a relatively weak repressor in 
      the absence of H-NS, while Fis also has a weak repressive effect. Salicin has no 
      effect on Pbgl activity but causes a 30-fold induction of bgl operon expression. 
      Induction depends on the activity of the BglF transporter/kinase. IS5 insertion 
      has only a moderate effect on Pbgl but causes a much greater activation of the 
      bgl operon expression by preventing the full repressive effects of H-NS and StpA. 
      While several other transcription factors (BglJ, RcsB, and LeuO) have been 
      reported to influence bgl operon transcription when overexpressed, they had 
      little or no effect when present at wild type levels. These results indicate the 
      important transcriptional regulatory mechanisms operative on the bgl operon in E. 
      coli.

TI  - Regulatory Interplay between RNase III and Antisense RNAs in E. coli: the Case of 
      AsflhD and FlhD, Component of the Master Regulator of Motility.
PG  - e0098122

LID - e00981-22
AB  - In order to respond to ever-changing environmental cues, bacteria display 
      resilient regulatory mechanisms controlling gene expression. At the 
      post-transcriptional level, this is achieved by a combination of RNA-binding 
      proteins, such as ribonucleases (RNases), and regulatory RNAs, including 
      antisense RNAs (asRNAs). Bound to their complementary mRNA, asRNAs are primary 
      targets for the double-strand-specific endoribonuclease, RNase III. Taking 
      advantage of our own and previously published transcriptomic data sets obtained 
      in strains inactivated for RNase III, we selected several candidate asRNAs and 
      confirmed the existence of RNase III-sensitive asRNAs for crp, ompR, phoP, and 
      flhD genes, all encoding global regulators of gene expression in Escherichia 
      coli. Using FlhD, a component of the master regulator of motility (FlhD(4)C(2)), 
      as our model, we demonstrate that the asRNA AsflhD, transcribed from the coding 
      sequence of flhD, is involved in the fine-tuning of flhD expression and thus 
      participates in the control of motility. IMPORTANCE The role of antisense RNAs 
      (asRNAs) in the regulation of gene expression remains largely unexplored in 
      bacteria. Here, we confirm that asRNAs can be part of layered regulatory 
      networks, since some are found opposite to genes encoding global regulators. In 
      particular, we show how an antisense RNA (AsflhD) to the flhD gene, encoding the 
      transcription factor serving as the primary regulator of bacterial swimming 
      motility (FlhD(4)C(2)), controls flhD expression, which in turn affects the 
      expression of other genes of the motility cascade. The role of AsflhD highlights

AB  - Microorganisms often live in symbiosis with their hosts, and some are considered 
      mutualists, where all species involved benefit from the interaction. How 
      free-living microorganisms have evolved to become mutualists is unclear. Here we 
      report an experimental system in which non-symbiotic Escherichia coli evolves 
      into an insect mutualist. The stinkbug Plautia stali is typically associated with 
      its essential gut symbiont, Pantoea sp., which colonizes a specialized symbiotic 
      organ. When sterilized newborn nymphs were infected with E. coli rather than 
      Pantoea sp., only a few insects survived, in which E. coli exhibited specific 
      localization to the symbiotic organ and vertical transmission to the offspring. 
      Through transgenerational maintenance with P. stali, several hypermutating E. 
      coli lines independently evolved to support the host's high adult emergence and 
      improved body colour; these were called 'mutualistic' E. coli. These mutants 
      exhibited slower bacterial growth, smaller size, loss of flagellar motility and 
      lack of an extracellular matrix. Transcriptomic and genomic analyses of 
      'mutualistic' E. coli lines revealed independent mutations that disrupted the 
      carbon catabolite repression global transcriptional regulator system. Each 
      mutation reproduced the mutualistic phenotypes when introduced into wild-type E. 
      coli, confirming that single carbon catabolite repression mutations can make E. 
      coli an insect mutualist. These findings provide an experimental system for 
      future work on host-microbe symbioses and may explain why microbial mutualisms 
      are omnipresent in nature.

TI  - A broadly applicable, stress-mediated bacterial death pathway regulated by the 
      phosphotransferase system (PTS) and the cAMP-Crp cascade.

AB  - Recent work indicates that killing of bacteria by diverse antimicrobial classes 
      can involve reactive oxygen species (ROS), as if a common, self-destructive 
      response to antibiotics occurs. However, the ROS-bacterial death theory has been 
      challenged. To better understand stress-mediated bacterial death, we enriched 
      spontaneous antideath mutants of Escherichia coli that survive treatment by 
      diverse bactericidal agents that include antibiotics, disinfectants, and 
      environmental stressors, without a priori consideration of ROS. The mutants 
      retained bacteriostatic susceptibility, thereby ruling out resistance. 
      Surprisingly, pan-tolerance arose from carbohydrate metabolism deficiencies in 
      ptsI (phosphotransferase) and cyaA (adenyl cyclase); these genes displayed the 
      activity of upstream regulators of a widely shared, stress-mediated death 
      pathway. The antideath effect was reversed by genetic complementation, exogenous 
      cAMP, or a Crp variant that bypasses cAMP binding for activation. Downstream 
      events comprised a metabolic shift from the TCA cycle to glycolysis and to the 
      pentose phosphate pathway, suppression of stress-mediated ATP surges, and reduced 
      accumulation of ROS. These observations reveal how upstream signals from diverse 
      stress-mediated lesions stimulate shared, late-stage, ROS-mediated events. 
      Cultures of these stable, pan-tolerant mutants grew normally and were therefore 
      distinct from tolerance derived from growth defects described previously. 
      Pan-tolerance raises the potential for unrestricted disinfectant use to 
      contribute to antibiotic tolerance and resistance. It also weakens host defenses, 
      because three agents (hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, and low pH) affected by 
      pan-tolerance are used by the immune system to fight infections. Understanding 
      and manipulating the PtsI-CyaA-Crp–mediated death process can help better control 
      pathogens and maintain beneficial microbiota during antimicrobial treatment.

AB  - The usage of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) as disinfectants has increased 
      dramatically since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, leading to potentially 
      accelerated emergence of antibiotic resistance. Long-term exposure to 
      subinhibitory level QACs can lead to multidrug resistance, but the contribution 
      of mutagenesis to resistance evolution is obscure. In this study, we subcultured 
      E. coli K-12 under subinhibitory (0.25 × and 0.5 × Minimum Inhibitory 
      Concentration, MIC) or inhibitory (1 × and 2 × MIC) concentrations of 
      benzalkonium chloride (BAC, mono-chained) or didecyldimethylammonium chloride 
      (DDAC, twin-chained) for 60 days. The sensitivity of QAC-adapted cells to five 
      typical antibiotics decreased significantly, and in particular, the MIC of 
      rifampicin increased by 85 times. E. coli adapted faster to BAC but developed 
      20-167% higher antibiotic resistance with 56% more mutations under DDAC exposure. 
      The broader mutations induced by QACs, including negative regulators (acrR, marR, 
      soxR, and crp), outer membrane proteins and transporters (mipA and sbmA), and RNA 
      polymerase (rpoB and rpoC), potentially contributed to the high multi-drug 
      resistance. After QACs stresses were removed, the phenotypic resistance induced 
      by subinhibitory concentrations of QACs was reversible, whereas that induced by 
      inhibitory concentrations of QACs was irreversible. The different patterns and 
      molecular mechanism of antibiotic resistance induced by BAC and DDAC is 
      informative to estimating the risks of broader QACs present at varied 
      concentrations in the environment.

TI  - The Escherichia coli Amino Acid Uptake Protein CycA: Regulation of Its Synthesis 
      and Practical Application in l-Isoleucine Production.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10030647 [doi]
LID - 647
AB  - Amino acid transport systems perform important physiological functions; their 
      role should certainly be considered in microbial production of amino acids. 
      Typically, in the context of metabolic engineering, efforts are focused on the 
      search for and application of specific amino acid efflux pumps. However, in 
      addition, importers can also be used to improve the industrial process as a 
      whole. In this study, the protein CycA, which is known for uptake of nonpolar 
      amino acids, was characterized from the viewpoint of regulating its expression 
      and range of substrates. We prepared a cycA-overexpressing strain and found that 
      it exhibited high sensitivity to branched-chain amino acids and their structural 
      analogues, with relatively increased consumption of these amino acids, suggesting 
      that they are imported by CycA. The expression of cycA was found to be dependent 
      on the extracellular concentrations of substrate amino acids. The role of some 
      transcription factors in cycA expression, including of Lrp and Crp, was studied 
      using a reporter gene construct. Evidence for the direct binding of Crp to the 
      cycA regulatory region was obtained using a gel-retardation assay. The enhanced 
      import of named amino acids due to cycA overexpression in the 
      l-isoleucine-producing strain resulted in a significant reduction in the 
      generation of undesirable impurities. This work demonstrates the importance of 
      uptake systems with respect to their application in metabolic engineering.

AB  - Evolution facilitates emergence of fitter phenotypes by efficient allocation of 
      cellular resources in conjunction with beneficial mutations. However, system-wide 
      pleiotropic effects that redress the perturbations to the apex node of the 
      transcriptional regulatory networks remain unclear. Here, we elucidate that 
      absence of global transcriptional regulator CRP in Escherichia coli results in 
      alterations in key metabolic pathways under glucose respiratory conditions, 
      favouring stress- or hedging-related functions over growth-enhancing functions. 
      Further, we disentangle the growth-mediated effects from the CRP 
      regulation-specific effects on these metabolic pathways. We quantitatively 
      illustrate that the loss of CRP perturbs proteome efficiency, as evident from 
      metabolic as well as ribosomal proteome fractions, that corroborated with 
      intracellular metabolite profiles. To address how E. coli copes with such 
      systemic defect, we evolved Δcrp mutant in the presence of glucose. Besides 
      acquiring mutations in the promoter of glucose transporter ptsG, the evolved 
      populations recovered the metabolic pathways to their pre-perturbed state coupled 
      with metabolite re-adjustments, which altogether enabled increased growth. By 
      contrast to Δcrp mutant, the evolved strains remodelled their proteome efficiency 
      towards biomass synthesis, albeit at the expense of carbon efficiency. Overall, 
      we comprehensively illustrate the genetic and metabolic basis of pleiotropic 
      effects, fundamental for understanding the growth physiology.

TI  - Regulation of ytfK by cAMP-CRP Contributes to SpoT-Dependent Accumulation of 
      (p)ppGpp in Response to Carbon Starvation YtfK Responds to Glucose Exhaustion.
PG  - 775164
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.775164 [doi]
LID - 775164
AB  - Guanosine penta- or tetraphosphate (known as (p)ppGpp) serves as second messenger 
      to respond to nutrient downshift and other environmental stresses, a phenomenon 
      called stringent response. Accumulation of (p)ppGpp promotes the coordinated 
      inhibition of macromolecule synthesis, as well as the activation of stress 
      response pathways to cope and adapt to harmful conditions. In Escherichia coli, 
      the (p)ppGpp level is tightly regulated by two enzymes, the (p)ppGpp synthetase 
      RelA and the bifunctional synthetase/hydrolase SpoT. We recently identified the 
      small protein YtfK as a key regulator of SpoT-mediated activation of stringent 
      response in E. coli. Here, we further characterized the regulation of ytfK. We 
      observed that ytfK is subjected to catabolite repression and is positively 
      regulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex. 
      Importantly, YtfK contributes to SpoT-dependent accumulation of (p)ppGpp and cell 
      survival in response to glucose starvation. Therefore, regulation of ytfK by the 
      cAMP-CRP appears important to adjust (p)ppGpp level and coordinate cellular 
      metabolism in response to glucose availability.

TI  - The secondary messenger ppGpp interferes with cAMP-CRP regulon by promoting CRP 
      acetylation in Escherichia coli.
PG  - e0259067

LID - e0259067
AB  - The cAMP-CRP regulon coordinates transcription regulation of several 
      energy-related genes, the lac operon among them. Lactose, or IPTG, induces the 
      lac operon expression by binding to the LacI repressor, and releasing it from the 
      promoter sequence. At the same time, the expression of the lac operon requires 
      the presence of the CRP-cAMP complex, which promotes the binding of the RNA 
      polymerase to the promoter region. The modified nucleotide cAMP accumulates in 
      the absence of glucose and binds to the CRP protein, but its ability to bind to 
      DNA can be impaired by lysine-acetylation of CRP. Here we add another layer of 
      control, as acetylation of CRP seems to be modified by ppGpp. In cells grown in 
      glycerol minimal media, ppGpp seems to repress the expression of lacZ, where 
      ΔrelA mutants show higher expression of lacZ than in WT. These differences 
      between the WT and ΔrelA strains seem to depend on the levels of acetylated CRP. 
      During the growth in minimal media supplemented with glycerol, ppGpp promotes the 
      acetylation of CRP by the Nε-lysine acetyltransferases YfiQ. Moreover, the 
      expression of the different genes involved in the production and degradation of 
      Acetyl-phosphate (ackA-pta) and the enzymatic acetylation of proteins (yfiQ) are 
      stimulated by the presence of ppGpp, depending on the growth conditions.

AB  - How do hierarchical gene regulation networks evolve in bacteria? 
      Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) influence the overall structure of bacterial 
      genomes, sigma factors and global transcription factors (TFs) control thousands 
      of genes, and many operons are regulated by highly specific TFs that in turn are 
      controlled allosterically by cellular metabolites. These regulatory hierarchies 
      have been shaped by millions of years of evolution to optimize fitness in 
      response to changing environmental conditions, but it is unclear how NAPs and TFs 
      relate and have evolved together. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp) is the 
      paradigmatic global TF in Escherichia coli, and here we report that mutations in 
      the topA gene compensate for loss of cAMP, showing that the interplay between Crp 
      and the supercoiling status of promoters is key to global stress response. 
      Furthermore, we observed an effect of apoCrp on gene expression in the absence of 
      its effector cAMP. This provides support for the proposed NAP-like role for Crp, 
      suggesting that it represents an intermediate point in the evolution of a 
      ligand-controlled TF from a NAP. IMPORTANCE Here we report that mutations in the

AB  - The evolution of microorganisms often involves changes of unclear relevance, such 
      as transient phenotypes and sequential development of multiple adaptive mutations 
      in hotspot genes. Previously, we showed that ageing colonies of an E. coli mutant 
      unable to produce cAMP when grown on maltose, accumulated mutations in the crp 
      gene (encoding a global transcription factor) and in genes involved in pyrimidine 
      metabolism such as cmk; combined mutations in both crp and cmk enabled 
      fermentation of maltose (which usually requires cAMP-mediated Crp activation for 
      catabolic pathway expression). Here, we study the sequential generation of 
      hotspot mutations in those genes, and uncover a regulatory role of pyrimidine 
      nucleosides in carbon catabolism. Cytidine binds to the cytidine regulator CytR, 
      modifies the expression of sigma factor 32 (RpoH), and thereby impacts global 
      gene expression. In addition, cytidine binds and activates a Crp mutant directly, 
      thus modulating catabolic pathway expression, and could be the catabolite 
      modulating factor whose existence was suggested by Jacques Monod and colleagues 
      in 1976. Therefore, transcription factor Crp appears to work in concert with CytR 
      and RpoH, serving a dual role in sensing both carbon availability and metabolic 
      flux towards DNA and RNA. Our findings show how certain alterations in metabolite 
      concentrations (associated with colony ageing and/or due to mutations in 
      metabolic or regulatory genes) can drive the evolution in non-growing cells.

AB  - During the life cycle of enteric bacterium Escherichia coli, it encounters a wide 
      spectrum of pH changes. The asymmetric dimer of the cAMP receptor protein, CRP, 
      plays a key role in regulating the expressions of genes and the survival of E. 
      coli. To elucidate the pH effects on the mechanism of signal transmission, we 
      present a combination of results derived from ITC, crystallography, and 
      computation. CRP responds to a pH change by inducing a differential effect on the 
      affinity for the binding events to the two cAMP molecules, ensuing in a 
      reversible conversion between positive and negative cooperativity at high and low 
      pH, respectively. The structures of four crystals at pH ranging from 7.8 to 6.5 
      show that CRP responds by inducing a differential effect on the structures of the 
      two subunits, particularly in the DNA binding domain. Employing the COREX/BEST 
      algorithm, computational analysis shows the change in the stability of residues 
      at each pH. The change in residue stability alters the connectivity between 
      residues including those in cAMP and DNA binding sites. Consequently, the 
      differential impact on the topology of the connectivity surface among residues in 
      adjacent subunits is the main reason for differential change in affinity; that 
      is, the pH-induced differential change in residue stability is the 
      biothermodynamic basis for the change in allosteric behavior. Furthermore, the 
      structural asymmetry of this homodimer amplifies the differential impact of any 
      perturbations. Hence, these results demonstrate that the combination of these 
      approaches can provide insights into the underlying mechanism of an apparent 
      complex allostery signal and transmission in CRP.

LID - 7871
AB  - The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is one of the best-known transcription 
      factors, regulating about 400 genes. The histone-like nucleoid structuring 
      protein (H-NS) is one of the nucleoid-forming proteins and is responsible for DNA 
      packaging and gene repression in prokaryotes. In this study, the binding of ppGpp 
      to CRP and H-NS was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. CRP from Escherichia 
      coli exhibited intrinsic fluorescence at 341 nm when excited at 280 nm. The 
      fluorescence intensity decreased in the presence of ppGpp. The dissociation 
      constant of 35 ± 3 µM suggests that ppGpp binds to CRP with a similar affinity to 
      cAMP. H-NS also shows intrinsic fluorescence at 329 nm. The fluorescence 
      intensity was decreased by various ligands and the calculated dissociation 
      constant for ppGpp was 80 ± 11 µM, which suggests that the binding site was 
      occupied fully by ppGpp under starvation conditions. This study suggests the 
      modulatory effects of ppGpp in gene expression regulated by CRP and H-NS. The 
      method described here may be applicable to many other proteins.

TI  - Mutational Activation of Antibiotic-Resistant Mechanisms in the Absence of Major 
      Drug Efflux Systems of Escherichia coli.
PG  - e0010921
LID - 10.1128/JB.00109-21 [doi]
LID - e00109-21
AB  - Mutations are one of the common means by which bacteria acquire resistance to 
      antibiotics. In an Escherichia coli mutant lacking major antibiotic efflux pumps 
      AcrAB and AcrEF, mutations can activate alternative pathways that lead to 
      increased antibiotic resistance. In this work, we isolated and characterized 
      compensatory mutations of this nature mapping in four different regulatory genes, 
      baeS, crp, hns, and rpoB. The gain-of-function mutations in baeS constitutively 
      activated the BaeSR two-component regulatory system to increase the expression of 
      the MdtABC efflux pump. Missense or insertion mutations in crp and hns caused 
      derepression of an operon coding for the MdtEF efflux pump. Interestingly, 
      despite the dependence of rpoB missense mutations on MdtABC for their antibiotic 
      resistance phenotype, neither the expression of the mdtABCD-baeSR operon nor that 
      of other known antibiotic efflux pumps went up. Instead, the transcriptome 
      sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed a gene expression profile resembling that of a 
      "stringent" RNA polymerase where protein and DNA biosynthesis pathways were 
      downregulated but pathways to combat various stresses were upregulated. Some of 
      these activated stress pathways are also controlled by the general stress sigma 
      factor RpoS. The data presented here also show that compensatory mutations can 
      act synergistically to further increase antibiotic resistance to a level similar 
      to the efflux pump-proficient parental strain. Together, the findings highlight a 
      remarkable genetic ability of bacteria to circumvent antibiotic assault, even in 
      the absence of a major intrinsic antibiotic resistance mechanism. IMPORTANCE 
      Antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens is a chronic health concern. 
      Bacteria possess or acquire various mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and 
      chief among them is the ability to accumulate beneficial mutations that often 
      alter antibiotic targets. Here, we explored E. coli's ability to amass mutations 
      in a background devoid of a major constitutively expressed efflux pump and 
      identified mutations in several regulatory genes that confer resistance by 
      activating specific or pleiotropic mechanisms.

LID - e10064
AB  - Microorganisms adjust metabolic activity to cope with diverse environments. While 
      many studies have provided insights into how individual pathways are regulated, 
      the mechanisms that give rise to coordinated metabolic responses are poorly 
      understood. Here, we identify the regulatory mechanisms that coordinate 
      catabolism and anabolism in Escherichia coli. Integrating protein, metabolite, 
      and flux changes in genetically implemented catabolic or anabolic limitations, we 
      show that combined global and local mechanisms coordinate the response to 
      metabolic limitations. To allocate proteomic resources between catabolism and 
      anabolism, E. coli uses a simple global gene regulatory program. Surprisingly, 
      this program is largely implemented by a single transcription factor, Crp, which 
      directly activates the expression of catabolic enzymes and indirectly reduces the 
      expression of anabolic enzymes by passively sequestering cellular resources 
      needed for their synthesis. However, metabolic fluxes are not controlled by this 
      regulatory program alone; instead, fluxes are adjusted mostly through passive 
      changes in the local metabolite concentrations. These mechanisms constitute a 
      simple but effective global regulatory program that coarsely partitions resources 
      between different parts of metabolism while ensuring robust coordination of 
      individual metabolic reactions.

AB  - Antibiotic treatment kills a large portion of a population, while a small, 
      tolerant subpopulation survives. Tolerant bacteria disrupt antibiotic efficacy 
      and increase the likelihood that a population gains antibiotic resistance, a 
      growing health concern. We examined how E. coli transcriptional networks changed 
      in response to lethal ampicillin concentrations. We are the first to apply 
      transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) analysis to antibiotic tolerance by 
      leveraging existing knowledge and our transcriptional data. TRN analysis shows 
      that gene expression changes specific to ampicillin treatment are likely caused 
      by specific sigma and transcription factors typically regulated by proteolysis. 
      These results demonstrate that to survive lethal concentration of ampicillin 
      specific regulatory proteins change activity and cause a coordinated 
      transcriptional response that leverages multiple gene systems.

AB  - Evolutionary arms races are broadly prevalent among organisms including bacteria, 
      which have evolved defensive strategies against various attackers. A common 
      microbial aggression mechanism is the type VI secretion system (T6SS), a 
      contact-dependent bacterial weapon used to deliver toxic effector proteins into 
      adjacent target cells. Sibling cells constitutively express immunity proteins 
      that neutralize effectors. However, less is known about factors that protect 
      non-sibling bacteria from T6SS attacks independently of cognate immunity 
      proteins. In this study, we observe that human Escherichia coli commensal strains 
      sensitive to T6SS attacks from Vibrio cholerae are protected when co-cultured 
      with glucose. We confirm that glucose does not impair V. cholerae T6SS activity. 
      Instead, we find that cells lacking the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), which 
      regulates expression of hundreds of genes in response to glucose, survive 
      significantly better against V. cholerae T6SS attacks even in the absence of 
      glucose. Finally, we show that the glucose-mediated T6SS protection varies with 
      different targets and killers. Our findings highlight the first example of an 
      extracellular small molecule modulating a genetically controlled response for 
      protection against T6SS attacks. This discovery may have major implications for 
      microbial interactions during pathogen-host colonization and survival of bacteria 
      in environmental communities.

TI  - An ideal spacing is required for the control of Class II CRP-dependent promoters 
      by the status of CRP K100.
LID - fnaa164 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnaa164 [doi]
AB  - Transcription activation by the Escherichia coli CRP at Class II promoters is 
      dependent on direct interactions between RNA polymerase and CRP, therefore the 
      spatial proximity between both proteins plays a significant role in the ability 
      of CRP to activate transcription. Using both in vivo and in vitro techniques, 
      here we demonstrate that the CRP K100 positive charge, adjacent to AR2, is 
      required for full promoter activity when CRP is optimally positioned. 
      Accordingly, K100 mediated activation is very position-dependent and our data 
      confirm that the largest impact of the K100 status on transcription activation 
      occurs when the spacing between the CRP binding site and the A2 of the -10 
      element is 22 bp. From the results of this study and the progress in the 
      understanding about open complex DNA scrunching, we propose that CRP-dependent 
      promoters should now be numbered by the distance from the center of the DNA site 
      for CRP and the most highly conserved base at position 2 of the -10 hexamer in 
      bacterial promoters.

TI  - Phosphate starvation controls lactose metabolism to produce recombinant protein 
      in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 9707-9718
LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-10935-y [doi]
AB  - Phosphate is one of the major constituents in growth media. It closely regulates 
      central carbon and energy metabolism. Biochemical reactions in central carbon 
      metabolism are known to be regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of 
      enzymes. Phosphate scarcity can limit microbial productivity. However, 
      microorganisms are evolved to grow in phosphate starvation environments. This 
      study investigates the effect of phosphate-starved response (PSR) stimuli in 
      wild-type and recombinant Escherichia coli cells cultivated in two different 
      substrates, lactose, and glycerol. Phosphate-starved E. coli culture sustained 
      bacterial growth despite the metabolic burden that emanated from recombinant 
      protein expression albeit with altered dynamics of substrate utilisation. 
      Induction of lactose in phosphate-starved culture led to a 2-fold improvement in 
      product titre of rSymlin and a 2.3-fold improvement in product titre of rLTNF as 
      compared with phosphate-unlimited culture. The results obtained in the study are 
      in agreement with the literature to infer that phosphate starvation or limitation 
      can slow down the microbial growth rate in order to produce recombinant proteins. 
      Further, under PSR conditions, gene expression analysis demonstrated that while 
      selected genes (gapdh, pykF, ppsA, icdA) in glycolysis and pentose phosphate 
      pathway (zwf, gnd, talB, tktA) were up-regulated, other genes in lactose (lacY, 
      lacA) and acetate (ackA, pta) pathway were down-regulated. We have demonstrated 
      that cra, crp, phoB, and phoR are involved in the regulation of central carbon 
      metabolism. We propose a novel cross-regulation between lactose metabolism and 
      phosphate starvation. UDP-galactose, a toxic metabolite that is known to cause 
      cell lysis, has been shown to be significantly reduced due to slow uptake of 
      lactose under PSR conditions. Therefore, E. coli employs a decoupling strategy by 
      limiting growth and redirecting metabolic resources to survive and produce 
      recombinant protein under phosphate starvation conditions. KEY POINTS: • 
      Phosphate starvation controls lactose metabolism, which results in less galactose 
      accumulation. • Phosphate starvation modulates metabolic flow of central carbon 
      metabolism. • Product titre improves by 2-fold due to phosphate starvation. • The 
      approach has been successfully applied to production of two different proteins.

AB  - Thermally processed food is an important part of the human diet. Heat-treatment, 
      however, promotes the formation of so-called Amadori rearrangement products, such 
      as fructoselysine. The gut microbiota including Escherichia coli can utilize 
      these compounds as a nutrient source. While the degradation route for 
      fructoselysine is well described, regulation of the corresponding pathway genes 
      frlABCD remained poorly understood. Here, we used bioinformatics combined with 
      molecular and biochemical analyses and show that fructoselysine metabolism in E. 
      coli is tightly controlled at the transcriptional level. The global regulator CRP 
      (CAP) as well as the alternative sigma factor σ32 (RpoH) contribute to promoter 
      activation at high cAMP-levels and inside warm-blooded hosts, respectively. In 
      addition, we identified and characterized a transcriptional regulator FrlR, 
      encoded adjacent to frlABCD, as fructoselysine-6-phosphate specific repressor. 
      Our study provides profound evidence that the interplay of global and 
      substrate-specific regulation is a perfect adaptation strategy to efficiently 
      utilize unusual substrates within the human gut environment.

AB  - Although high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is an interesting parameter to be 
      applied in bioprocessing, its potential is currently limited by the lack of 
      bacterial chassis capable of surviving and maintaining homeostasis under 
      pressure. While several efforts have been made to genetically engineer 
      microorganisms able to grow at sublethal pressures, there is little information 
      for designing backgrounds that survive more extreme pressures. In this 
      investigation, we analyzed the genome of an extreme HHP-resistant mutant of E. 
      coli MG1655 (designated as DVL1), from which we identified four mutations (in the 
      cra, cyaA, aceA and rpoD loci) causally linked to increased HHP resistance. 
      Analysing the functional effect of these mutations we found that the coupled 
      effect of downregulation of cAMP/CRP, Cra and the glyoxylate shunt activity, 
      together with the upregulation of RpoH and RpoS activity, could mechanistically 
      explain the increased HHP resistance of the mutant. Using combinations of three 
      mutations, we could synthetically engineer E. coli strains able to comfortably 
      survive pressures of 600-800 MPa, which could serve as genetic backgrounds for 
      HHP-based biotechnological applications.

      Escherichia coli.
LID - fnaa083 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnaa083 [doi]
AB  - Bile salts, including sodium deoxycholate (DOC), are secreted into the intestine 
      to aid fat digestion and contribute to antimicrobial protection. Gram-negative 
      pathogens such as Escherichia coli, however, are highly resistant to DOC, using 
      multiple mechanisms of which the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC is the dominant 
      one. Given that TolC-mediated efflux masks the interaction of DOC with potential 
      targets, we sought to identify those targets by identifying genes whose mutations 
      cause an increase in the MIC to DOC relative to the ∆tolC parental strain, that 
      lacks TolC-associated functional efflux pumps. Using a mutant screen, we isolated 
      twenty independent spontaneous mutants that had a higher MICDOC than the E. coli 
      parental ∆tolC strain. Whole genome sequencing of these mutants mapped most 
      mutations to the ptsI or cyaA gene. Analysis of knock-out mutants and 
      complementation showed that elimination of PtsI, a component of the carbohydrate 
      phosphotransferase system, or one of the two key proteins involved in cAMP 
      synthesis and signaling, adenylate cyclase (CyaA) or cAMP receptor protein (Crp) 
      causes low-level increased resistance of a ∆tolC E. coli strain to DOC.

LID - e3000706
AB  - Transcription activation by cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CAP) is the 
      classic paradigm of transcription regulation in bacteria. CAP was suggested to 
      activate transcription on class-II promoters via a recruitment and isomerization 
      mechanism. However, whether and how it modifies RNA polymerase (RNAP) to initiate 
      transcription remains unclear. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 
      structures of an intact Escherichia coli class-II CAP-dependent transcription 
      activation complex (CAP-TAC) with and without de novo RNA transcript. The 
      structures reveal two distinct architectures of TAC and raise the possibility 
      that CAP binding may induce substantial conformational changes in all the 
      subunits of RNAP and transiently widen the main cleft of RNAP to facilitate DNA 
      promoter entering and formation of the initiation open complex. These structural 
      changes vanish during further RNA transcript synthesis. The observations in this 
      study may reveal a possible on-pathway intermediate and suggest a possibility 
      that CAP activates transcription by inducing intermediate state, in addition to 
      the previously proposed stabilization mechanism.

AB  - Escherichia coli cells respond to a period of famine by globally reorganizing 
      their gene expression. The changes are known as the stringent response, which is 
      orchestrated by the alarmone ppGpp that binds directly to RNA polymerase. The 
      resulting changes in gene expression are particularly well studied in the case of 
      amino acid starvation. We used deep RNA sequencing in combination with spike-in 
      cells to measure global changes in the transcriptome after valine-induced 
      isoleucine starvation of a standard E. coli K12 strain. Owing to the whole-cell 
      spike-in method that eliminates variations in RNA extraction efficiency between 
      samples, we show that ribosomal RNA levels are reduced during isoleucine 
      starvation and we quantify how the change in cellular RNA content affects 
      estimates of gene regulation. Specifically, we show that standard data 
      normalization relying on sample sequencing depth underestimates the number of 
      down-regulated genes in the stringent response and overestimates the number of 
      up-regulated genes by approximately 40%. The whole-cell spike-in method also made 
      it possible to quantify how rapidly the pool of total messenger RNA (mRNA) 
      decreases upon amino acid starvation. A principal component analysis showed that 
      the first two components together described 69% of the variability of the data, 
      underlining that large and highly coordinated regulons are at play in the 
      stringent response. The induction of starvation by sudden addition of high valine 
      concentrations provoked prominent regulatory responses outside of the expected 
      ppGpp, RpoS, and Lrp regulons. This underlines the notion that with the high 
      resolution possible in deep RNA sequencing analysis, any different starvation 
      method (e.g., nitrogen-deprivation, removal of an amino acid from an auxotroph 
      strain, or valine addition to E. coli K12 strains) will produce measurable 
      variations in the stress response produced by the cells to cope with the specific 
      treatment.

TI  - Glycine Cleavage System and cAMP Receptor Protein Co-Regulate CRISPR/cas3 
      Expression to Resist Bacteriophage.

AB  - The CRISPR/Cas system protects bacteria against bacteriophage and plasmids 
      through a sophisticated mechanism where cas operon plays a crucial role 
      consisting of cse1 and cas3. However, comprehensive studies on the regulation of 
      cas3 operon of the Type I-E CRISPR/Cas system are scarce. Herein, we investigated 
      the regulation of cas3 in Escherichia coli. The mutation in gcvP or crp reduced 
      the CRISPR/Cas system interference ability and increased bacterial susceptibility 
      to phage, when the casA operon of the CRISPR/Cas system was activated. The 
      silence of the glycine cleavage system (GCS) encoded by gcvTHP operon reduced 
      cas3 expression. Adding N(5), N(10)-methylene tetrahydrofolate (N(5), 
      N(10)-mTHF), which is the product of GCS-catalyzed glycine, was able to activate 
      cas3 expression. In addition, a cAMP receptor protein (CRP) encoded by crp 
      activated cas3 expression via binding to the cas3 promoter in response to cAMP 
      concentration. Since N(5), N(10)-mTHF provides one-carbon unit for purine, we 
      assumed GCS regulates cas3 through associating with CRP. It was evident that the 
      mutation of gcvP failed to further reduce the cas3 expression with the crp 
      deletion. These results illustrated a novel regulatory pathway which GCS and CRP 
      co-regulate cas3 of the CRISPR/Cas system and contribute to the defence against 
      invasive genetic elements, where CRP is indispensable for GCS regulation of cas3 
      expression.

AB  - The theory for allostery has evolved to a modern energy landscape ensemble 
      theory, the major feature of which is the existence of multiple microstates in 
      equilibrium. The properties of microstates are not well defined due to their 
      transient nature. Characterization of apo protein microstates is important 
      because the specific complex of the ligand-bound microstate defines the 
      biological function. The information needed to link biological function and 
      structure is a quantitative correlation of the energy landscapes between the apo 
      and holo protein states. We employed the Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein 
      (CRP) system to test the features embedded in the ensemble theory because 
      multiple crystalline apo and holo structures are available. Small angle X-ray 
      scattering data eliminated one of the three apo states but not the other two. We 
      defined the underlying energy landscape differences among the apo microstates by 
      employing the computation algorithm COREX/BEST. The same connectivity patterns 
      among residues in apo CRP are retained upon binding of cAMP. The microstates of 
      apo CRP differ from one another by minor structural perturbations, resulting in 
      changes in the energy landscapes of the various domains of CRP. Using the 
      differences in energy landscapes among these apo states, we computed the cAMP 
      binding energetics that were compared with solution biophysical results. Only one 
      of the three apo microstates yielded data consistent with the solution data. The 
      relative magnitude of changes in energy landscapes embedded in various apo 
      microstates apparently defines the ultimate outcome of the cooperativity of 
      binding.

AB  - In the absence of sugars, C4-dicarboxylates (C4DC) like fumarate represent 
      important substrates for growth of Escherichia coli. Aerobically, C4DCs are 
      oxidized to CO(2) whereas anaerobically, C4DCs are used for fumarate respiration. 
      In order to determine the impact of fumarate under aerobic and anaerobic 
      conditions, proteomes of E. coli W3110 grown aerobically or anaerobically with 
      fumarate and/or the non-C4DC substrate glycerol were comparatively profiled by 
      nanoLC-MS/MS. Membrane enrichment allowed sensitive detection of membrane 
      proteins. A total of 1657 proteins of which 646 and 374 were assigned to the 
      cytosol or membrane, respectively, were covered. Presence of fumarate triggered 
      changes (≥ 2fold) to the levels of 211 and 76 proteins under aerobic and 
      anaerobic growth, respectively. The fumarate induced changes included proteins 
      encoded by genes regulated by the C4DC two-component system DcuS-DcuR (DctA, 
      DcuB, FumB, FrdABC proteins) catalyzing uptake and initial catabolic steps. Many 
      of the proteins displaying altered levels are not part of the DcuS-DcuR regulon, 
      including proteins of citric acid cycle and associated pathways (aerobic), 
      proteins involved in motility and chemotaxis (anaerobic), and oxidative stress. 
      Their genes are mostly preceded by cAMP receptor protein (CRP) sites, some by 
      DcuR-like sites. Testing of selected genes confirmed regulation by CRP and 
      DcuS-DcuR. SIGNIFICANCE: Global protein profiling of the soluble and the membrane 
      fraction provides a comprehensive view on the protein pattern of E. coli grown 
      aerobically and anaerobically with or without fumarate. The results disclose 
      during aerobic growth besides the known impact of the C4-dicarboxylates (C4DC) on 
      carbon utilization and citric acid cycle major adaptations in amino acid 
      metabolism. In contrast, protein alterations in the presence of fumarate under 
      anaerobic conditions point to enhanced motility and chemotaxis. Only proteins 
      (transporters, initial metabolic steps) feeding external C4DCs to the central 
      pathways were regulated by the C4DC two-component system DcuS-DcuR, whereas other 
      protein levels were controlled in an indirect manner by CRP triggered catabolite 
      control and other mechanisms. Consequently, metabolic and transcriptional 
      regulation by C4DCs is apparently effected by a network of the DcuS-DcuR system 
      with important contribution by catabolite control.

AB  - Horizontal gene transfer through natural competence is an important driving force 
      of bacterial evolution and antibiotic resistance development. In several 
      Gram-negative pathogens natural competence is regulated by the concerted action 
      of cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and the transcriptional co-regulator Sxy through a 
      subset of CRP-binding sites (CRP-S sites) at genes encoding competence factors. 
      Despite the wealth of knowledge on CRP's structure and function it is not known 
      how CRP and Sxy act together to activate transcription. In order to get an 
      insight into the regulatory mechanism by which these two proteins activate gene 
      expression, we performed a series of mutational analyses on CRP and Sxy. We found 
      that CRP contains a previously uncharacterized region necessary for Sxy dependent 
      induction of CRP-S sites, here named "Sxy Interacting Region" (SIR) encompassing 
      residues Q194 and L196. Lost promoter induction in SIR mutants could be restored 
      in the presence of specific complementary Sxy mutants, presenting evidence for a 
      direct interaction of CRP and Sxy proteins in transcriptional activation. 
      Moreover, we identified constitutive mutants of Sxy causing higher levels of 
      CRP-S site promoter activation than wild-type Sxy. Both suppressor and 
      constitutive mutations are located within the same area of Sxy.

TI  - Differential modulation of energy landscapes of cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) 
      as a regulatory mechanism for class II CRP-dependent promoters.
PG  - 15544-15556
LID - 10.1074/jbc.RA119.009151 [doi]
AB  - The Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein, CRP, is a homodimeric global 
      transcription activator that employs multiple mechanisms to modulate the 
      expression of hundreds of genes. These mechanisms require different interfacial 
      interactions among CRP, RNA, and DNA of varying sequences. The involvement of 
      such a multiplicity of interfaces requires a tight control to ensure the desired 
      phenotype. CRP-dependent promoters can be grouped into three classes. For decades 
      scientists in the field have been puzzled over the differences in mechanisms 
      between class I and II promoters. Using a new crystal structure, IR spectroscopy, 
      and computational analysis, we defined the energy landscapes of WT and 14 mutated 
      CRPs to determine how a homodimeric protein can distinguish nonpalindromic DNA 
      sequences and facilitate communication between residues located in three 
      different activation regions (AR) in CRP that are ∼30 Å apart. We showed that 
      each mutation imparts differential effects on stability among the subunits and 
      domains in CRP. Consequently, the energetic landscapes of subunits and domains 
      are different, and CRP is asymmetric. Hence, the same mutation can exert 
      different effects on ARs in class I or II promoters. The effect of a mutation is 
      transmitted through a network by long-distance communication not necessarily 
      relying on physical contacts between adjacent residues. The mechanism is simply 
      the sum of the consequences of modulating the synchrony of dynamic motions of 
      residues at a distance, leading to differential effects on ARs in different 
      subunits. The computational analysis is applicable to any system and potentially 
      with predictive capability.

TI  - Discovering a novel D-xylonate-responsive promoter: the P(yjhI)-driven genetic 
      switch towards better 1,2,4-butanetriol production.
PG  - 8063-8074
LID - 10.1007/s00253-019-10073-0 [doi]
AB  - The capability of Escherichia coli to catabolize D-xylonate is a crucial 
      component for building and optimizing the Dahms pathway. It relies on the 
      inherent dehydratase and keto-acid aldolase activities of E. coli. Although the 
      biochemical characteristics of these enzymes are known, their inherent expression 
      regulation remains unclear. This knowledge is vital for the optimization of 
      D-xylonate assimilation, especially in addressing the problem of D-xylonate 
      accumulation, which hampers both cell growth and target product formation. In 
      this report, molecular biology techniques and synthetic biology tools were 
      combined to build a simple genetic switch controller for D-xylonate. First, 
      quantitative and relative expression analysis of the gene clusters involved in 
      D-xylonate catabolism were performed, revealing two D-xylonate-inducible operons, 
      yagEF and yjhIHG. The 5'-flanking DNA sequence of these operons were then 
      subjected to reporter gene assays which showed P(yjhI) to have low background 
      activity and wide response range to D-xylonate. A P(yjhI)-driven synthetic 
      genetic switch was then constructed containing feedback control to autoregulate 
      D-xylonate accumulation and to activate the expression of the genes for 
      1,2,4-butanetriol (BTO) production. The genetic switch effectively reduced 
      D-xylonate accumulation, which led to 31% BTO molar yield, the highest for direct 
      microbial fermentation systems thus far. This genetic switch can be further 
      modified and employed in the production of other compounds from D-xylose through 
      the xylose oxidative pathway.

TI  - DIpartite: A tool for detecting bipartite motifs by considering base 
      interdependencies.
PG  - e0220207
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0220207 [doi]
LID - e0220207
AB  - It is extremely important to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). 
      Some TFBSs are proposed to be bipartite motifs known as two-block motifs 
      separated by gap sequences with variable lengths. While position weight matrix 
      (PWM) is commonly used for the representation and prediction of TFBSs, 
      dinucleotide weight matrix (DWM) enables expression of the interdependencies of 
      neighboring bases. By incorporating DWM into the detection of bipartite motifs, 
      we have developed a novel tool for ab initio motif detection, DIpartite 
      (bipartite motif detection tool based on dinucleotide weight matrix) using a 
      Gibbs sampling strategy and the minimization of Shannon's entropy. DIpartite 
      predicts the bipartite motifs by considering the interdependencies of neighboring 
      positions, that is, DWM. We compared DIpartite with other available alternatives 
      by using test datasets, namely, of CRP in E. coli, sigma factors in B. subtilis, 
      and promoter sequences in humans. We have developed DIpartite for the detection 
      of TFBSs, particularly bipartite motifs. DIpartite enables ab initio prediction 
      of conserved motifs based on not only PWM, but also DWM. We evaluated the 
      performance of DIpartite by comparing it with freely available tools, such as 
      MEME, BioProspector, BiPad, and AMD. Taken the obtained findings together, 
      DIpartite performs equivalently to or better than these other tools, especially 
      for detecting bipartite motifs with variable gaps. DIpartite requires users to 
      specify the motif lengths, gap length, and PWM or DWM. DIpartite is available for 
      use at https://github.com/Mohammad-Vahed/DIpartite.

PG  - 730-736
LID - 10.1016/j.csbj.2019.05.009 [doi]
AB  - The Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP or catabolite activator 
      protein, CAP) provides a textbook example of bacterial transcriptional regulation 
      and is one of the best studied transcription factors in biology. For almost five 
      decades a large number of mutants, evolved in vivo or engineered in vitro, have 
      shed light on the molecular structure and mechanism of CRP. Here, we review 
      previous work, providing an overview of studies describing the isolation of CRP 
      mutants. Furthermore, we present new data on deep sequencing of different 
      bacterial populations that have evolved under selective pressure that strongly 
      favors mutations in the crp locus. Our new approach identifies more than 100 new 
      CRP mutations and paves the way for a deeper understanding of this fascinating 
      bacterial master regulator.

TI  - Generation of hydrogen sulfide from sulfur assimilation in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 234-239
LID - 10.2323/jgam.2018.11.001 [doi]
AB  - Many organisms produce endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) as a by-product of 
      protein, peptide, or L-cysteine degradation. Recent reports concerning mammalian 
      cells have demonstrated that H(2)S acts as a signaling molecule playing important 
      roles in various biological processes. In contrast to mammals, bacterial H(2)S 
      signaling remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli 
      generates H(2)S through the assimilation of inorganic sulfur, without L-cysteine 
      degradation. Comparison of phenotypes and genomes between laboratory E. coli K-12 
      strains revealed a major contribution of CRP (a protein that controls the 
      expression of numerous genes involved in glycolysis) to H(2)S generation. We 
      found that H(2)S was produced by cells growing in a synthetic minimal medium 
      containing thiosulfate as a sole inorganic sulfur source, but not in a medium 
      only containing sulfate. Furthermore, E. coli generated H(2)S in a CRP-dependent 
      manner as a response to glucose starvation. These results indicate that CRP plays 
      a key role in the generation of H(2)S coupled to thiosulfate assimilation, whose 
      molecular mechanisms remains to be elucidated. Here, we propose a potential 
      biological role of the H(2)S as a signaling mediator for a cross-talk between 
      carbon and sulfur metabolism in E. coli.

TI  - Measuring cis-regulatory energetics in living cells using allelic manifolds.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.40618 [doi]
LID - e40618
AB  - Gene expression in all organisms is controlled by cooperative interactions 
      between DNA-bound transcription factors (TFs), but quantitatively measuring 
      TF-DNA and TF-TF interactions remains difficult. Here we introduce a strategy for 
      precisely measuring the Gibbs free energy of such interactions in living cells. 
      This strategy centers on the measurement and modeling of 'allelic manifolds', a 
      multidimensional generalization of the classical genetics concept of allelic 
      series. Allelic manifolds are measured using reporter assays performed on 
      strategically designed cis-regulatory sequences. Quantitative biophysical models 
      are then fit to the resulting data. We used this strategy to study regulation by 
      two Escherichia coli TFs, CRP and [Formula: see text] RNA polymerase. Doing so, 
      we consistently obtained energetic measurements precise to [Formula: see text] 
      kcal/mol. We also obtained multiple results that deviate from the prior 
      literature. Our strategy is compatible with massively parallel reporter assays in 
      both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and should therefore be highly scalable and 
      broadly applicable. EDITORIAL NOTE: This article has been through an editorial 
      process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during 
      peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that minor issues remain 
      unresolved (see decision letter).

AB  - Despite decades of studies meant to analyse the bacterial response to carbon 
      limitation, we still miss a high-resolution overview of the situation. All gene 
      expression changes observed in such conditions cannot solely be accounted for by 
      the global regulator Crp either free or bound to its effector, cyclic AMP. Here, 
      for the first time, we evaluated the response of both CDS (protein-coding 
      sequence) and ncRNA (non-coding RNA) genes to carbon limitation, revealed 
      cellular functions of differentially expressed genes systematically, quantified 
      the contribution of Crp-cAMP and other factors to regulation and deciphered 
      regulation strategies at a genomewide scale. Approximately one-third of the 
      differentially expressed genes we identified responded to Crp-cAMP via its direct 
      or indirect control, while the remaining genes were subject to growth 
      rate-dependent control or were controlled by other regulators, especially RpoS. 
      Importantly, gene regulation mechanisms can be established by expression pattern 
      studies. Here, we propose a comprehensive picture of how cells respond to carbon 
      scarcity. The global regulation strategies thus exposed illustrate that the 
      response of cell to carbon scarcity is not limited to maintaining sufficient 
      carbon metabolism via cAMP signalling while the main response is to adjust 
      metabolism to cope with a slow growth rate.

TI  - A cAMP/CRP-controlled mechanism for the incorporation of extracellular 
      ADP-glucose in Escherichia coli involving NupC and NupG nucleoside transporters.

AB  - ADP-glucose is the precursor of glycogen biosynthesis in bacteria, and a compound 
      abundant in the starchy plant organs ingested by many mammals. Here we show that 
      the enteric species Escherichia coli is capable of scavenging exogenous 
      ADP-glucose for use as a glycosyl donor in glycogen biosynthesis and feed the 
      adenine nucleotide pool. To unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in this 
      process, we screened the E. coli single-gene deletion mutants of the Keio 
      collection for glycogen content in ADP-glucose-containing culture medium. In 
      comparison to wild-type (WT) cells, individual ∆nupC and ∆nupG mutants lacking 
      the cAMP/CRP responsive inner-membrane nucleoside transporters NupC and NupG 
      displayed reduced glycogen contents and slow ADP-glucose incorporation. In 
      concordance, ∆cya and ∆crp mutants accumulated low levels of glycogen and slowly 
      incorporated ADP-glucose. Two-thirds of the glycogen-excess mutants identified 
      during screening lacked functions that underlie envelope biogenesis and 
      integrity, including the RpoE specific RseA anti-sigma factor. These mutants 
      exhibited higher ADP-glucose uptake than WT cells. The incorporation of either 
      ∆crp, ∆nupG or ∆nupC null alleles sharply reduced the ADP-glucose incorporation 
      and glycogen content initially witnessed in ∆rseA cells. Overall, the data showed 
      that E. coli incorporates extracellular ADP-glucose through a cAMP/CRP-regulated 
      process involving the NupC and NupG nucleoside transporters that is facilitated 
      under envelope stress conditions.

TI  - Influence of Glucose Availability and CRP Acetylation on the Genome-Wide 
      Transcriptional Response of Escherichia coli: Assessment by an Optimized 
      Factorial Microarray Analysis.

AB  - Background: While in eukaryotes acetylation/deacetylation regulation exerts 
      multiple pleiotropic effects, in Escherichia coli it seems to be more limited and 
      less known. Hence, we aimed to progress in the characterization of this 
      regulation by dealing with three convergent aspects: the effector enzymes 
      involved, the master regulator CRP, and the dependence on glucose availability. 
      Methods: The transcriptional response of E. coli BW25113 was analyzed across 14 
      relevant scenarios. These conditions arise when the wild type and four isogenic 
      mutants (defective in deacetylase CobB, defective in N(ε)-lysine acetyl 
      transferase PatZ, Q- and R-type mutants of protein CRP) are studied under three 
      levels of glucose availability (glucose-limited chemostat and glucose-excess or 
      glucose-exhausted in batch culture). The Q-type emulates a permanent stage of 
      CRP(acetylated), whereas the R-type emulates a permanent stage of 
      CRP(deacetylated). The data were analyzed by an optimized factorial microarray 
      method (Q-GDEMAR). Results: (a) By analyzing one mutant against the other, we 
      were able to unravel the true genes that participate in the interaction between 
      ΔcobB/ΔpatZ mutations and glucose availability; (b) Increasing stages of glucose 
      limitation appear to be associated with the up-regulation of specific sets of 
      target genes rather than with the loss of genes present when glucose is in 
      excess; (c) Both CRP(deacetylated) and CRP(acetylated) produce extensive changes 
      in specific subsets of genes, but their number and identity depend on the glucose 
      availability; (d) In other sub-sets of genes, the transcriptional effect of CRP 
      seems to be independent of its acetylation or deacetylation; (e) Some specific 
      ontology functions can be associated with each of the different sets of genes 
      detected herein. Conclusions: CRP cannot be thought of only as an effector of 
      catabolite repression, because it acts along all the glucose conditions tested 
      (excess, limited, and exhausted), exerting both positive and negative effects 
      through different sets of genes. Acetylation of CRP does not seem to be a binary 
      form of regulation, as there is not a univocal relationship between its 
      activation/inhibitory effect and its acetylation/deacetylation stage. All the 
      combinatorial possibilities are observed. During the exponential growth phase, 
      CRP also exerts a very significant transcriptional effect, mainly on flagellar 
      assembly and chemotaxis (FDR = 7.2 × 10(-44)).

TI  - Effect of ZnO quantum dots on Escherichia coli global transcription regulator: A 
      molecular investigation.

AB  - ZnO quantum dots (QDs) are very well known for their antimicrobial activity 
      against several bacteria, however, we still do not know any protein targets of 
      ZnO QDs. In order to determine possible protein target, interaction of ZnO QDs 
      was studied with CRP (Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein), a global transcription 
      regulator protein. Binding between ZnO QDs and E. coli CRP was mainly studied by 
      isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), structural changes of protein were 
      monitored by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, and in-vitro 
      transcription assay was used to asses CRP activity. Result shows that both 
      electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are involved in CRP-ZnO binding. 
      Different spectroscopic investigation revealed that ZnO binding to CRP leads to 
      extensive unfolding and destabilization, which ultimately leads to protein 
      aggregation. It was also observed that in presence of ZnO dimerization ability of 
      CRP was sharply reduced. In-vitro transcription assay also shows that CRP 
      activity gets severely compromised on ZnO binding. All our data suggests that ZnO

AB  - The phenotype of Escherichia coli is governed by global transcriptional 
      regulators under variable environmental conditions. Fnr, ArcA, IhfA-B, Crp, and 
      Fis are amongst the major global transcription regulators that change their 
      activity across the range of aeration, hence forming the core transcriptional 
      network responsible for survival under changing aeration conditions. Effect of 
      deletion of these global transcription factors on the kinetics of cell growth and 
      mixed acid production under anaerobic fermentation conditions has not been 
      characterized. To quantify the kinetic parameters in the absence of global 
      transcription factors, experiments were performed using single deletion mutants 
      of the above-mentioned global transcription regulators. The absence of global 
      transcription regulators resulted in a relatively higher glucose uptake rate than 
      that required for the observed growth rate. This further resulted in a higher 
      yield of mixed acids per unit biomass in mutants as compared to the parent strain 
      (E. coli BW25113). Thus, the increased channeling of carbon towards mixed acid 
      secretion resulted in a lower growth rate in the mutants.

      regulation in bacteria.
PG  - E4796-E4805
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1722055115 [doi]
AB  - Gene regulation is one of the most ubiquitous processes in biology. However, 
      while the catalog of bacterial genomes continues to expand rapidly, we remain 
      ignorant about how almost all of the genes in these genomes are regulated. At 
      present, characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which individual regulatory 
      sequences operate requires focused efforts using low-throughput methods. Here, we 
      take a first step toward multipromoter dissection and show how a combination of 
      massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry, and information-theoretic 
      modeling can be used to dissect multiple bacterial promoters in a systematic way. 
      We show this approach on both well-studied and previously uncharacterized 
      promoters in the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli In all cases, we recover 
      nucleotide-resolution models of promoter mechanism. For some promoters, including 
      previously unannotated ones, the approach allowed us to further extract 
      quantitative biophysical models describing input-output relationships. Given the 
      generality of the approach presented here, it opens up the possibility of 
      quantitatively dissecting the mechanisms of promoter function in E. coli and a 
      wide range of other bacteria.

TI  - cAMP-CRP acts as a key regulator for the viable but non-culturable state in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 410-419
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.000618 [doi]
AB  - A variety of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, are known to enter the viable 
      but non-culturable (VBNC) state under various stress conditions. During this 
      state, cells lose colony-forming activities on conventional agar plates while 
      retaining signs of viability. Diverse environmental stresses including starvation 
      induce the VBNC state. However, little is known about the genetic mechanism 
      inducing this state. Here, we aimed to reveal the genetic determinants of the 
      VBNC state of E. coli. We hypothesized that the VBNC state is a process wherein 
      specific gene products important for colony formation are depleted during the 
      extended period of stress conditions. If so, higher expression of these genes 
      would maintain colony-forming activities, thereby restraining cells from entering 
      the VBNC state. From an E. coli plasmid-encoded ORF library, we identified genes 
      that were responsible for maintaining high colony-forming activities after 
      exposure to starvation condition. Among these, cpdA encoding cAMP 
      phosphodiesterase exhibited higher performance in the maintenance of 
      colony-forming activities. As cpdA overexpression decreases intracellular cAMP, 
      cAMP or its complex with cAMP-receptor protein (CRP) may negatively regulate 
      colony-forming activities under stress conditions. We confirmed this using 
      deletion mutants lacking adenylate cyclase or CRP. These mutants fully maintained 
      colony-forming activities even after a long period of starvation, while wild-type 
      cells lost most of this activity. Thus, we concluded that the lack of cAMP-CRP 
      effectively retains high colony-forming activities, indicating that cAMP-CRP acts 
      as a positive regulator necessary for the induction of the VBNC state in E. coli.

TI  - The genes of the sulphoquinovose catabolism in Escherichia coli are also 
      associated with a previously unknown pathway of lactose degradation.
PG  - 3177
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-21534-3 [doi]
LID - 3177
AB  - Comparative genomics analysis of conserved gene cassettes demonstrated 
      resemblance between a recently described cassette of genes involved in 
      sulphoquinovose degradation in Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and a Bacilli 
      cassette linked with lactose degradation. Six genes from both cassettes had 
      similar functions related to carbohydrate metabolism, namely, hydrolase, 
      aldolase, kinase, isomerase, transporter, and transcription factor. The 
      Escherichia coli sulphoglycolysis cassette was thus predicted to be associated 
      with lactose degradation. This prediction was confirmed experimentally: 
      expression of genes coding for aldolase (yihT), isomerase (yihS), and kinase 
      (yihV) was dramatically increased during growth on lactose. These genes were 
      previously shown to be activated during growth on sulphoquinovose, so our 
      observation may indicate multi-functional capabilities of the respective 
      proteins. Transcription starts for yihT, yihV and yihW were mapped in silico, in 
      vitro and in vivo. Out of three promoters for yihT, one was active only during 
      growth on lactose. We further showed that switches in yihT transcription are 
      controlled by YihW, a DeoR-family transcription factor in the Escherichia coli 
      cassette. YihW acted as a carbon source-dependent dual regulator involved in 
      sustaining the baseline growth in the absence of lac-operon, with function either 
      complementary, or opposite to a global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism, 
      cAMP-CRP.

TI  - ThreaDNA: predicting DNA mechanics' contribution to sequence selectivity of 
      proteins along whole genomes.
PG  - 609-616
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx634 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Many DNA-binding proteins recognize their target sequences 
      indirectly, by sensing DNA's response to mechanical distortion. ThreaDNA 
      estimates this response based on high-resolution structures of the protein-DNA 
      complex of interest. Implementing an efficient nanoscale modeling of DNA 
      deformations involving essentially no adjustable parameters, it returns the 
      profile of deformation energy along whole genomes, at base-pair resolution, 
      within minutes on usual laptop/desktop computers. Our predictions can also be 
      easily combined with estimations of direct selectivity through a generalized form 
      of position-weight-matrices. The formalism of ThreaDNA is accessible to a wide 
      audience. RESULTS: We demonstrate the importance of indirect readout for the 
      nucleosome as well as the bacterial regulators Fis and CRP. Combined with the 
      direct contribution provided by usual sequence motifs, it significantly improves 
      the prediction of sequence selectivity, and allows quantifying the two distinct 
      physical mechanisms underlying it. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Python 
      software available at bioinfo.insa-lyon.fr, natively executable on Linux/MacOS 
      systems with a user-friendly graphical interface. Galaxy webserver version 
      available. CONTACT: sam.meyer@insa-lyon.fr. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

AB  - Bacterial morphology is a complex trait that is highly sensitive to changes in 
      the environment. For heterotrophic organisms, such as Escherichia coli, increases 
      in nutrient levels are frequently accompanied by several-fold increases in both 
      size and growth rate. Despite the dramatic nature of these changes, how 
      alterations in nutrient availability translate into changes in growth and 
      morphology remains a largely open question. To understand the signaling networks 
      coupling nutrient availability with size and shape, we examined the impact of 
      deletions in the entirety of non-essential central carbon metabolic genes on E. 
      coli growth rate and cell size. Our data reveal the presence of multiple 
      metabolic nodes that play important yet distinctive roles in dictating 
      biosynthetic capacity and shaping cell morphology. Specifically, perturbations of 
      acetyl-CoA metabolism impact cell size and division through changes in fatty acid 
      synthesis. Additionally, we identify a genetic pathway linking glucose levels to 
      cell width through the signaling molecule cyclic-AMP. Together our findings 
      highlight a surprising diversity of factors and mechanisms contributing to growth 
      potential and cell morphology, providing a foundation for further studies.

TI  - PredCRP: predicting and analysing the regulatory roles of CRP from its binding

AB  - Cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), a global regulator in Escherichia coli, 
      regulates more than 180 genes via two roles: activation and repression. Few 
      methods are available for predicting the regulatory roles from the binding sites 
      of transcription factors. This work proposes an accurate method PredCRP to derive 
      an optimised model (named PredCRP-model) and a set of four interpretable rules 
      (named PredCRP-ruleset) for predicting and analysing the regulatory roles of CRP 
      from sequences of CRP-binding sites. A dataset consisting of 169 CRP-binding 
      sites with regulatory roles strongly supported by evidence was compiled. The 
      PredCRP-model, using 12 informative features of CRP-binding sites, and 
      cooperating with a support vector machine achieved a training and test accuracy 
      of 0.98 and 0.93, respectively. PredCRP-ruleset has two activation rules and two 
      repression rules derived using the 12 features and the decision tree method C4.5. 
      This work further screened and identified 23 previously unobserved regulatory 
      interactions in Escherichia coli. Using quantitative PCR for validation, 
      PredCRP-model and PredCRP-ruleset achieved a test accuracy of 0.96 (=22/23) and 
      0.91 (=21/23), respectively. The proposed method is suitable for designing 
      predictors for regulatory roles of all global regulators in Escherichia coli.

AB  - Catabolite repression refers to the process where the metabolism of one sugar 
      represses the genes involved in metabolizing another sugar. While glucose 
      provides the canonical example, many other sugars are also known to induce 
      catabolite repression. However, less is known about the mechanism for catabolite 
      repression by these non-glucose sugars. In this work, we investigated the 
      mechanism of catabolite repression in the bacterium Escherichia coli during 
      growth on lactose, L-arabinose, and D-xylose. The metabolism of these sugars is 
      regulated in a hierarchical manner, where lactose is the preferred sugar, 
      followed by L-arabinose, and then D-xylose. Previously, the preferential 
      utilization of L-arabinose over D-xylose was found to result from transcriptional 
      crosstalk. However, others have proposed that cAMP governs the hierarchical 
      regulation of many non-glucose sugars. We investigated whether lactose-induced 
      repression of L-arabinose and D-xylose gene expression is due to transcriptional 
      crosstalk or cAMP. Our results demonstrate that it is due to cAMP and not 
      transcriptional crosstalk. In addition, we found that repression is reciprocal, 
      where both L-arabinose and D-xylose also repress the lactose gene expression, 
      albeit to a lesser extent and also through a mechanism involving cAMP. 
      Collectively, the results further our understanding of metabolism during growth 
      on multiple sugars.

AB  - Here, we investigated novel interactions of three global regulators of the 
      network that controls biofilm formation in the model bacterium Escherichia coli 
      using computational network analysis, an in vivo reporter assay and physiological 
      validation experiments. We were able to map critical nodes that govern planktonic 
      to biofilm transition and identify 8 new regulatory interactions for CRP, IHF or 
      Fis responsible for the control of the promoters of rpoS, rpoE, flhD, fliA, csgD 
      and yeaJ. Additionally, an in vivo promoter reporter assay and motility analysis 
      revealed a key role for IHF as a repressor of cell motility through the control 
      of FliA sigma factor expression. This investigation of first stage and mature 
      biofilm formation indicates that biofilm structure is strongly affected by IHF 
      and Fis, while CRP seems to provide a fine-tuning mechanism. Taken together, the 
      analysis presented here shows the utility of combining computational and 
      experimental approaches to generate a deeper understanding of the biofilm 
      formation process in bacteria.

      factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP) is responsible for much of this regulation. 
      Questions remain, however, regarding the regulation of CRP activity itself. Here, 
      we demonstrate that a lysine (K100) on the surface of CRP has a dual function: to 
      promote CRP activity at Class II promoters, and to ensure proper CRP steady state 
      levels. Both functions require the lysine's positive charge; intriguingly, the 
      positive charge of K100 can be neutralized by acetylation using the central 
      metabolite acetyl phosphate as the acetyl donor. We propose that CRP K100 
      acetylation could be a mechanism by which the cell downwardly tunes CRP-dependent 
      Class II promoter activity, whilst elevating CRP steady state levels, thus 
      indirectly increasing Class I promoter activity. This mechanism would operate 
      under conditions that favor acetate fermentation, such as during growth on 
      glucose as the sole carbon source or when carbon flux exceeds the capacity of the 
      central metabolic pathways.

AB  - Regulation of gene expression in bacteria results from the interplay between 
      hundreds of transcriptional factors (TFs) at target promoters. However, how the 
      arrangement of binding sites for TFs generates the regulatory logic of promoters 
      is not well-known. Here, we generated and fully characterized a library of 
      synthetic complex promoters for the global regulators, CRP and IHF, in 
      Escherichia coli, which are formed by a weak -35/-10 consensus sequence preceded 
      by four combinatorial binding sites for these two TFs. Using this approach, we 
      found that while cis-elements for CRP preferentially activate promoters when 
      located immediately upstream of the promoter consensus, binding sites for IHF 
      mainly function as "UP" elements and stimulate transcription in several different 
      architectures in the absence of this protein. However, the combination of CRP- 
      and IHF-binding sites resulted in emergent properties in these complex promoters, 
      where the activity of combinatorial promoters cannot be predicted from the 
      individual behavior of its components. Taken together, the results presented here 
      add to the information on architecture-logic of complex promoters in bacteria.

TI  - Gly184 of the Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein provides optimal context for 
      both DNA binding and RNA polymerase interaction.
PG  - 816-822

AB  - The Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP) utilizes the helix-turn-helix 
      motif for DNA binding. The CRP's recognition helix, termed F-helix, includes a 
      stretch of six amino acids (Arg180, Glu181, Thr182, Val183, Gly184, and Arg185) 
      for direct DNA contacts. Arg180, Glu181 and Arg185 are known as important 
      residues for DNA binding and specificity, but little has been studied for the 
      other residues. Here we show that Gly184 is another F-helix residue critical for 
      the transcriptional activation function of CRP. First, glycine was repeatedly 
      selected at CRP position 184 for its unique ability to provide wild type-level 
      transcriptional activation activity. To dissect the glycine requirement, wild 
      type CRP and mutants G184A, G184F, G184S, and G184Y were purified and their in 
      vitro DNA-binding activity was measured. G184A and G184F displayed reduced DNA 
      binding, which may explain their low transcriptional activation activity. 
      However, G184S and G184Y displayed apparently normal DNA affinity. Therefore, an 
      additional factor is needed to account for the diminished transcriptional 
      activation function in G184S and G184Y, and the best explanation is perturbations 
      in their interaction with RNA polymerase. The fact that glycine is the smallest 
      amino acid could not fully warrant its suitability, as shown in this study. We 
      hypothesize that Gly184 fulfills the dual functions of DNA binding and RNA 
      polymerase interaction by conferring conformational flexibility to the F-helix.

AB  - One of the best-studied transcriptional regulatory proteins in bacteria is the 
      Escherichia coli catabolite repressor protein (CRP) that when complexed with 
      3'-5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) changes its conformation and interacts with specific 
      DNA-sequences. CRP DNA-binding can result in positive or negative regulation of 
      gene expression depending on the position of its interaction with respect to RNA 
      polymerase binding site. The aim of this work is to review the biological role 
      and phylogenetic relations that some members of the CRP family of transcriptional 
      regulators (also known as cAMP receptor protein family) have in different 
      bacterial species. This work is not intended to give an exhaustive revision of 
      bacterial CRP-orthologs, but to provide examples of the role that these proteins 
      play in the expression of genes that are fundamental for the life style of some 
      bacterial species. We highlight the conservation of their structural 
      characteristics and of their binding to conserved-DNA sequences, in contrast to 
      their very diverse repertoire of gene activation. CRP activates a wide variety of 
      fundamental genes for the biological characteristic of each bacterial species, 
      which in several instances form part of their core-genome (defined as the gene 
      sequences present in all members of a bacterial species). We present evidence 
      that support the fact that some of the transcriptional regulators that belong to 
      the CRP family in different bacterial species, and some of the genes that are 
      regulated by them, can be inherited by horizontal gene transfer. These data are 
      discussed in the framework of bacterial evolution models.

AB  - Global transcription factors are known to regulate the anaerobic growth of 
      Escherichia coli on glucose. These transcription factors help the organism to 
      sense oxygen and accordingly regulate the synthesis of mixed acid producing 
      enzymes. Five global transcription factors, namely ArcA, Fnr, IhfA-B, Crp and 
      Fis, are known to play an important role in the growth phenotype of the organism 
      in the transition from anaerobic to aerobic conditions. The effect of deletion of 
      most of these global transcription factors on the growth phenotype has not been 
      characterized under strict anaerobic fermentation conditions. In order to 
      enumerate the role of global transcription factors in central carbon metabolism, 
      experiments were performed using single deletion mutants of the above mentioned 
      global transcription regulators. The mutants demonstrated lower growth rates, 
      ranging from 3-75% lower growth as compared to the wild-type strain along with 
      varying glucose uptake rates. Global transcription regulators help in lowering 
      formate and acetate synthesis, thereby effectively channeling the carbon towards 
      redox balance (through ethanol formation) and biomass synthesis. Flux analysis of 
      mutant strains indicated that deletion of a single transcription factor alone 
      does not play a significant role in the normalized flux distribution of the 
      central carbon metabolism.

PG  - 781-792
LID - 10.1111/mmi.13662 [doi]
AB  - Antitoxins encoded by type II toxin - antitoxin (TA) modules neutralize cognate 
      toxins by direct protein - protein contact and in addition, regulate TA operon 
      transcription by binding to operators in the promoter regions. On top of the 
      simple negative feed-back regulation, canonical type II TA operons are regulated 
      by a mechanism called 'Conditional Cooperativity'(CC). In CC, the cellular 
      toxin:antitoxin (T:A) ratio controls the transcription-rate such that low T:A 
      ratios favour repression and high T:A ratios favour de-repression of TA operon 
      transcription. Here a new molecular mechanism that secures selective synthesis of 
      antitoxin in the presence of excess toxin was unravelled. The hicAB locus of E. 
      coli K-12 encodes HicA mRNase and HicB antitoxin. It was shown that hicAB is 
      transcribed by two promoters, an upstream one that is activated by CRP-cAMP and 
      competence factor Sxy and a downstream one that is autorepressed solely by HicB. 
      Excess HicA destabilizes the HicB•operator complex in vitro and consistently, 
      activates hicAB transcription in vivo. Remarkably, the hicAB transcript 
      synthesized from the HicB-controlled promoter produces HicB but not HicA. Thus, 
      the HicA-mediated derepression of hicAB transcription provides a mechanism that 
      conditionally and selectively stimulates synthesis of HicB antitoxin under 
      conditions of excess HicA toxin.

AB  - Although cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) has long served as a typical example 
      of effector-mediated protein allostery, mechanistic details into its regulation 
      have been controversial due to discrepancy between the known crystal structure 
      and NMR structure of apo-CRP. Here, we report that the recombinant protein 
      corresponding to its C-terminal DNA-binding domain (CDD) forms a dimer. This 
      result, together with structural information obtained in the present NMR study, 
      is consistent with the previous crystal structure and validates its relevance 
      also in solution. Therefore, our findings suggest that dissociation of the CDD 
      may be critically involved in cAMP-induced allosteric activation of CRP.

TI  - Multiple Transcriptional Factors Regulate Transcription of the rpoE Gene in 
      Escherichia coli under Different Growth Conditions and When the 
      Lipopolysaccharide Biosynthesis Is Defective.
PG  - 22999-23019
AB  - The RpoE σ factor is essential for the viability of Escherichia coli RpoE 
      regulates extracytoplasmic functions including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
      translocation and some of its non-stoichiometric modifications. Transcription of 
      the rpoE gene is positively autoregulated by Eσ(E) and by unknown mechanisms that 
      control the expression of its distally located promoter(s). Mapping of 5' ends of 
      rpoE mRNA identified five new transcriptional initiation sites (P1 to P5) located 
      distal to Eσ(E)-regulated promoter. These promoters are activated in response to 
      unique signals. Of these P2, P3, and P4 defined major promoters, recognized by 
      RpoN, RpoD, and RpoS σ factors, respectively. Isolation of trans-acting factors, 
      in vitro transcriptional and gel retardation assays revealed that the 
      RpoN-recognized P2 promoter is positively regulated by a QseE/F two-component 
      system and NtrC activator, whereas the RpoD-regulated P3 promoter is positively 
      regulated by a Rcs system in response to defects in LPS core biosynthesis, 
      overproduction of certain lipoproteins, and the global regulator CRP. Strains 
      synthesizing Kdo(2)-LA LPS caused up to 7-fold increase in the rpoEP3 activity, 
      which was abrogated in Δ(waaC rcsB). Overexpression of a novel 73-nucleotide sRNA 
      rirA (RfaH interacting RNA) generated by the processing of 5' UTR of the waaQ 
      mRNA induces the rpoEP3 promoter activity concomitant with a decrease in LPS 
      content and defects in the O-antigen incorporation. In the presence of RNA 
      polymerase, RirA binds LPS regulator RfaH known to prevent premature 
      transcriptional termination of waaQ and rfb operons. RirA in excess could titrate 
      out RfaH causing LPS defects and the activation of rpoE transcription.

TI  - Circuitry Linking the Catabolite Repression and Csr Global Regulatory Systems of 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 3000-3015
AB  - Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the cAMP receptor protein (cAMP-CRP) and CsrA are the 
      principal regulators of the catabolite repression and carbon storage global 
      regulatory systems, respectively. cAMP-CRP controls the transcription of genes 
      for carbohydrate metabolism and other processes in response to carbon nutritional 
      status, while CsrA binds to diverse mRNAs and regulates translation, RNA 
      stability, and/or transcription elongation. CsrA also binds to the regulatory 
      small RNAs (sRNAs) CsrB and CsrC, which antagonize its activity. The BarA-UvrY 
      two-component signal transduction system (TCS) directly activates csrB and csrC 
      (csrB/C) transcription, while CsrA does so indirectly. We show that cAMP-CRP 
      inhibits csrB/C transcription without negatively regulating phosphorylated UvrY 
      (P-UvrY) or CsrA levels. A crp deletion caused an elevation in CsrB/C levels in 
      the stationary phase of growth and increased the expression of csrB-lacZ and 
      csrC-lacZ transcriptional fusions, although modest stimulation of CsrB/C turnover 
      by the crp deletion partially masked the former effects. DNase I footprinting and 
      other studies demonstrated that cAMP-CRP bound specifically to three sites 
      located upstream from the csrC promoter, two of which overlapped the P-UvrY 
      binding site. These two proteins competed for binding at the overlapping sites. 
      In vitro transcription-translation experiments confirmed direct repression of 
      csrC-lacZ expression by cAMP-CRP. In contrast, cAMP-CRP effects on csrB 
      transcription may be mediated indirectly, as it bound nonspecifically to csrB 
      DNA. In the reciprocal direction, CsrA bound to crp mRNA with high affinity and 
      specificity and yet exhibited only modest, conditional effects on expression. Our 
      findings are incorporated into an emerging model for the response of Csr 
      circuitry to carbon nutritional status. IMPORTANCE: Csr (Rsm) noncoding small 
      RNAs (sRNAs) CsrB and CsrC of Escherichia coli use molecular mimicry to sequester 
      the RNA binding protein CsrA (RsmA) away from lower-affinity mRNA targets, thus 
      eliciting major shifts in the bacterial lifestyle. CsrB/C transcription and 
      turnover are activated by carbon metabolism products (e.g., formate and acetate) 
      and by a preferred carbon source (glucose), respectively. We show that cAMP-CRP, 
      a mediator of classical catabolite repression, inhibits csrC transcription by 
      binding to the upstream region of this gene and also inhibits csrB transcription, 
      apparently indirectly. We propose that glucose availability activates pathways 
      for both synthesis and turnover of CsrB/C, thus shaping the dynamics of global 
      signaling in response to the nutritional environment by poising CsrB/C sRNA 
      levels for rapid response.

TI  - Transcriptional Regulation of the Outer Membrane Porin Gene ompW Reveals its 
      Physiological Role during the Transition from the Aerobic to the Anaerobic 
      Lifestyle of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 799
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2016.00799 [doi]

AB  - Understanding bacterial physiology relies on elucidating the regulatory 
      mechanisms and cellular functions of those differentially expressed genes in 
      response to environmental changes. A widespread Gram-negative bacterial outer 
      membrane protein OmpW has been implicated in the adaptation to stresses in 
      various species. It is recently found to be present in the regulon of the global 
      anaerobic transcription factor FNR and ArcA in Escherichia coli. However, little 
      is known about the physiological implications of this regulatory disposition. In 
      this study, we demonstrate that transcription of ompW is indeed mediated by a 
      series of global regulators involved in the anaerobiosis of E. coli. We show that 
      FNR can both activate and repress the expression of ompW through its direct 
      binding to two distinctive sites, -81.5 and -126.5 bp respectively, on ompW 
      promoter. ArcA also participates in repression of ompW under anaerobic condition, 
      but in an FNR dependent manner. Additionally, ompW is also subject to the 
      regulation by CRP and NarL which senses the availability and types of carbon 
      sources and respiration electron acceptors in the environment respectively, 
      implying a role of OmpW in the carbon and energy metabolism of E. coli during its 
      anaerobic adaptation. Molecular docking reveals that OmpW can bind fumarate, an 
      alternative electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration, with sufficient affinity. 
      Moreover, supplement of fumarate or succinate which belongs to the 
      C4-dicarboxylates family of metabolite, to E. coli culture rescues OmpW-mediated 
      colicin S4 killing. Taken together, we propose that OmpW is involved in anaerobic 
      carbon and energy metabolism to mediate the transition from aerobic to anaerobic 
      lifestyle in E. coli.

TI  - Control of hexuronate metabolism in Escherichia coli by the two interdependent 
      regulators, ExuR and UxuR: derepression by heterodimer formation.
PG  - 1220-1231
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.000297 [doi]
AB  - Two homologous proteins, UxuR and ExuR, were previously predicted to repress 
      synthesis of enzymes required for hexuronic acid metabolism, but little is known 
      about the relative roles of these proteins in gene regulation. We confirmed the 
      previous report that UxuR is essential for rapid growth with d-glucuronate as the 
      primary source of carbon and energy. In contrast, an exuR mutant grew more 
      rapidly on d-glucuronate than the parent. Transcription of exuR is initiated at a 
      σ70-dependent promoter predicted in silico. Purified ExuR bound to the exuR 
      regulatory region in the presence, but not in the absence, of d-glucuronate. 
      Apparently weaker UxuR binding in the presence of glucuronate was also detected, 
      and its addition decreased ExuR binding by forming ExuR-UxuR heterodimers. 
      Glucuronate induced exuR transcription in the parental strain, but not in the 
      exuR mutant. No evidence was obtained for cAMP-dependent regulation of exuR by 
      the catabolite repressor protein (CRP). A previous study reported that the 
      divergent yjjM and yjjN genes, essential for l-galactonate metabolism, are 
      repressed by UxuR. We showed that ExuR binds to the yjjM-yjjN regulatory region, 
      and that the binding is also glucuronate-dependent. As for the exuR promoter, 
      UxuR appeared to decrease ExuR binding. ExuR is required for glucuronate 
      induction of yjjM and yjjN, and CRP is required for their transcription. The 
      combined data established that UxuR and ExuR fulfil contrasting roles in 
      regulating hexuronic acid metabolism and indicate that ExuR can function as a 
      transcription activator, possibly by inactivating the repressor function of UxuR 
      by heterodimer formation.

TI  - Transcription profile of Escherichia coli: genomic SELEX search for regulatory 
      targets of transcription factors.
PG  - 2058-74
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkw051 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial genomes are transcribed by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP), which 
      achieves gene selectivity through interaction with sigma factors that recognize 
      promoters, and transcription factors (TFs) that control the activity and 
      specificity of RNAP holoenzyme. To understand the molecular mechanisms of 
      transcriptional regulation, the identification of regulatory targets is needed 
      for all these factors. We then performed genomic SELEX screenings of targets 
      under the control of each sigma factor and each TF. Here we describe the assembly 
      of 156 SELEX patterns of a total of 116 TFs performed in the presence and absence 
      of effector ligands. The results reveal several novel concepts: (i) each TF 
      regulates more targets than hitherto recognized; (ii) each promoter is regulated 
      by more TFs than hitherto recognized; and (iii) the binding sites of some TFs are 
      located within operons and even inside open reading frames. The binding sites of 
      a set of global regulators, including cAMP receptor protein, LeuO and Lrp, 
      overlap with those of the silencer H-NS, suggesting that certain global 
      regulators play an anti-silencing role. To facilitate sharing of these 
      accumulated SELEX datasets with the research community, we compiled a database, 
      'Transcription Profile of Escherichia coli' (www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/tec/).

AB  - Bacterial persisters represent a small number of slow-growing antibiotic-tolerant 
      cells among populations of rapidly growing cells, and are the main cause of 
      frequent recurrent infections. MqsR-MqsA, the toxin-antitoxin (TA) pair, is the 
      most frequently induced TA system associated with antibiotic persistence in 
      Escherichia coli. In this study, we show that the cyclic AMP receptor protein 
      (CRP) indirectly upregulates mqsRA transcription. We also show that CRP plays an 
      important role in antibiotic persistence, which seems to be partially mediated 
      through MqsRA. Overall, this study highlights the role of CRP as an important 
      regulator of antibiotic persistence in E. coli.

      pocket.
PG  - 26587-96
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.678474 [doi]
AB  - The Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP) requires cAMP binding to undergo 
      a conformational change for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Two CRP 
      residues, Thr(127) and Ser(128), are known to play important roles in cAMP 
      binding through hydrogen bonding and in the cAMP-induced conformational change, 
      but the connection between the two is not completely clear. Here, we 
      simultaneously randomized the codons for these two residues and selected CRP 
      mutants displaying high CRP activity in a cAMP-producing E. coli. Many different 
      CRP mutants satisfied the screening condition for high CRP activity, including 
      those that cannot form any hydrogen bonds with the incoming cAMP at the two 
      positions. In vitro DNA-binding analysis confirmed that these selected CRP 
      mutants indeed display high CRP activity in response to cAMP. These results 
      indicate that the hydrogen bonding ability of the Thr(127) and Ser(128) residues 
      is not critical for the cAMP-induced CRP activation. However, the hydrogen 
      bonding ability of Thr(127) and Ser(128) was found to be important in attaining 
      high cAMP affinity. Computational analysis revealed that most natural 
      cAMP-sensing CRP homologs have Thr/Ser, Thr/Thr, or Thr/Asn at positions 127 and 
      128. All of these pairs are excellent hydrogen bonding partners and they do not 
      elevate CRP activity in the absence of cAMP. Taken together, our analyses suggest 
      that CRP evolved to have hydrogen bonding residues at the cAMP pocket residues 
      127 and 128 for performing dual functions: preserving high cAMP affinity and 
      keeping CRP inactive in the absence of cAMP.

TI  - Positive Effect of Carbon Sources on Natural Transformation in Escherichia coli: 
      Role of Low-Level Cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP Receptor Protein in the Derepression of 
      rpoS.
PG  - 3317-28
LID - 10.1128/JB.00291-15 [doi]
AB  - Natural plasmid transformation of Escherichia coli is a complex process that 
      occurs strictly on agar plates and requires the global stress response factor 
      σ(S). Here, we showed that additional carbon sources could significantly enhance 
      the transformability of E. coli. Inactivation of phosphotransferase system genes 
      (ptsH, ptsG, and crr) caused an increase in the transformation frequency, and the 
      addition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) neutralized the promotional effect of carbon 
      sources. This implies a negative role of cAMP in natural transformation. Further 
      study showed that crp and cyaA mutations conferred a higher transformation 
      frequency, suggesting that the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex has an 
      inhibitory effect on transformation. Moreover, we observed that rpoS is 
      negatively regulated by cAMP-CRP in early log phase and that both crp and cyaA 
      mutants show no transformation superiority when rpoS is knocked out. Therefore, 
      it can be concluded that both the crp and cyaA mutations derepress rpoS 
      expression in early log phase, whereby they aid in the promotion of natural 
      transformation ability. We also showed that the accumulation of RpoS during early 
      log phase can account for the enhanced transformation aroused by additional 
      carbon sources. Our results thus demonstrated that the presence of additional 
      carbon sources promotes competence development and natural transformation by 
      reducing cAMP-CRP and, thus, derepressing rpoS expression during log phase. This 
      finding could contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between 
      nutrition state and competence, as well as the mechanism of natural plasmid 
      transformation in E. coli. IMPORTANCE: Escherichia coli, which is not usually 
      considered to be naturally transformable, was found to spontaneously take up 
      plasmid DNA on agar plates. Researching the mechanism of natural transformation 
      is important for understanding the role of transformation in evolution, as well 
      as in the transfer of pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance genes. In this 
      work, we found that carbon sources significantly improve transformation by 
      decreasing cAMP. Then, the low level of cAMP-CRP derepresses the general stress 
      response regulator RpoS via a biphasic regulatory pattern, thereby contributing 
      to transformation. Thus, we demonstrate the mechanism by which carbon sources 
      affect natural transformation, which is important for revealing information about 
      the interplay between nutrition state and competence development in E. coli.

AB  - We established that Escherichia coli strain 15 (ATCC 9723) produces both curli 
      and cellulose, and forms robust biofilms. Since this strain is wild type with 
      respect to the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), it is 
      an ideal strain in which to investigate the effects of the PTS on the biofilm 
      growth of E. coli. We began by looking into the effects of PTS and non-PTS sugars 
      on the biofilm growth of this strain. All the sugars tested tended to activate 
      biofilm growth at low concentrations but to inhibit biofilm growth at high 
      concentrations. Acidification of the medium was an inhibitory factor in the 
      absence of buffer, but buffering to prevent a pH drop did not prevent the 
      inhibitory effects of the sugars. The concentration at which inhibition set in 
      varied from sugar to sugar. For most sugars, cyclic (c)AMP counteracted the 
      inhibition at the lowest inhibitory concentrations but became ineffective at 
      higher concentrations. Our results suggest that cAMP-dependent catabolite 
      repression, which is mediated by the PTS in E. coli, plays a role in the 
      regulation of biofilm growth in response to sugars. cAMP-independent processes, 
      possibly including Cra, also appear to be involved, in addition to pH effects.

AB  - When bacteria are cultured in medium with multiple carbon substrates, they 
      frequently consume these substrates simultaneously. Building on recent advances 
      in the understanding of metabolic coordination exhibited by Escherichia coli 
      cells through cAMP-Crp signaling, we show that this signaling system responds to 
      the total carbon-uptake flux when substrates are co-utilized and derive a 
      mathematical formula that accurately predicts the resulting growth rate, based 
      only on the growth rates on individual substrates.

TI  - Impacts of global transcriptional regulators on persister metabolism.
PG  - 2713-9
LID - 10.1128/AAC.04908-14 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial persisters are phenotypic variants with an extraordinary capacity to 
      tolerate antibiotics, and they are hypothesized to be a main cause of chronic and 
      relapsing infections. Recent evidence has suggested that the metabolism of 
      persisters can be targeted to develop therapeutic countermeasures; however, 
      knowledge of persister metabolism remains limited due to difficulties associated 
      with isolating these rare and transient phenotypic variants. By using a technique 
      to measure persister catabolic activity, which is based on the ability of 
      metabolites to enable aminoglycoside (AG) killing of persisters, we investigated 
      the role of seven global transcriptional regulators (ArcA, Cra, cyclic AMP [cAMP] 
      receptor protein [CRP], DksA, FNR, Lrp, and RpoS) on persister metabolism. We 
      found that removal of CRP resulted in a loss of AG potentiation in persisters for 
      all metabolites tested. These results highlight a central role for cAMP/CRP in 
      persister metabolism, as its perturbation can significantly diminish the 
      metabolic capabilities of persisters and effectively eliminate the ability of AGs 
      to eradicate these troublesome bacteria.

TI  - Cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) regulates the expression of cspA, cspB, cspG 
      and cspI, members of cspA family, in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 497-501
LID - 10.1007/s00203-015-1085-4 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli K-12 contains nine paralogs of CspA, CspA-CspI, collectively 
      known as CspA family of cold-shock proteins (CSPs). In spite of the high degree 
      of similarity among themselves, only five (cspA, B, E, G and I) are induced 
      during cold-stress. In the present study, we show that cspB, cspG and cspI, the 
      members of cspA family, known to be induced in response to cold shock, are 
      regulated by cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) , a global regulator involved in 
      sugar metabolism, during growth at 37 °C as well as at 15 °C, as seen by green 
      fluorescent protein (gfp) promoter fusions assays. Interestingly, cspA is 
      selectively regulated by CRP during growth at 15 °C but not at 37 °C. The 
      regulation of cspA, cspB, cspG and cspI by CRP was found to be through an 
      indirect mechanism as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). 
      These results substantiate our earlier study demonstrating a role for CRP during 
      growth at low temperature.

AB  - Natural competence, the ability of bacteria to take up exogenous DNA and 
      incorporate it into their chromosomes, is in most bacteria a transient phenomenon 
      under complex genetic and environmental control. In the Gram-negative bacteria 
      Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae, the master regulator Sxy/TfoX 
      controls competence development. Although not known to be naturally competent, 
      Escherichia coli possesses a Sxy homologue and a competence regulon containing 
      the genes required for DNA uptake. Here, we show that in contrast to other 
      characterised Gamma-proteobacteria, E. coli Sxy is positively autoregulated at 
      the level of transcription by a mechanism that requires cAMP receptor protein 
      (CRP), cyclic AMP (cAMP) and a CRP-S site in the sxy promoter. Similarly, we 
      found no evidence that Sxy expression in E. coli was regulated at the 
      translational level. However, our analysis revealed that Sxy is an unstable 
      protein and that its cellular level is negatively regulated at the 
      post-translational level via degradation by Lon protease. Interestingly, in the 
      Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, the competence master regulator 
      ComK is also positively autoregulated at the level of transcription and 
      negatively regulated by proteolysis. Together, these findings reveal striking 
      similarities between the competence regulons of a Gram-positive and a 
      Gram-negative bacterium.

TI  - Involvement of cAMP-CRP in transcription activation and repression of the pck

PG  - 93-9
LID - 10.1111/1574-6968.12466 [doi]
AB  - cAMP receptor protein (CRP) is the best characterized global regulator of 
      Escherichia coli. After genomic SELEX screening, a total of minimum 378 promoters 
      have been identified as its regulation targets on the E. coli genome. Among a 
      number of promoters carrying two CRP-binding sites, several promoters carry two 
      CRP-binding sites, one upstream but another downstream of transcription 
      initiation sites. The regulatory role of downstream CRP site remains unsolved. 
      Using the pck gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase as a model 
      promoter, we analyzed the role of CRP-associated downstream of the transcription 
      initiation site. Gel shift assay and AFM observation indicate that CRP binds to 
      both the promoter-distal site (CRP box-1) at -90.5 and the site (CRP box-2) at 
      +13.5 downstream of transcription initiation site. The binding affinity is higher 
      for CRP box-1. Roles of two CRP sites were examined using in vitro transcription 
      assay and in vivo reporter assay. In both cases, transcription repression was 
      observed in the presence of high concentrations of CRP. Taken together, we 
      propose that cAMP-CRP associated at downstream CRP box-2 plays as a repressor for 
      pck transcription only in the presence of high levels of cAMP-CRP.

TI  - CRP represses the CRISPR/Cas system in Escherichia coli: evidence that endogenous 
      CRISPR spacers impede phage P1 replication.
PG  - 1072-91
LID - 10.1111/mmi.12614 [doi]
AB  - The CRISPR/Cas system is an important aspect in bacterial immunology. The 
      anti-phage activity of the CRISPR system has been established using synthetic 
      CRISPR spacers, but in vivo studies of endogenous CRISPR spacers are relatively 
      scarce. Here, we showed that bacteriophage P1 titre in Escherichia coli decreased 
      in the glucose-containing medium compared with that in the absence of glucose. 
      This glucose effect of E. coli against phage P1 infection disappeared in cse3 
      deletion mutants. The effect on the susceptibility to phage P1 was associated 
      with cAMP receptor protein (CRP)-mediated repression of cas genes transcription 
      and crRNA maturation. Analysis of the regulatory element in the cse1 promoter 
      region revealed a novel CRP binding site, which overlapped with a LeuO binding 
      site. Furthermore, the limited sequence identity between endogenous spacers and 
      the phage P1 genome was necessary and sufficient for CRISPR-mediated repression 
      of phage P1 replication. Trans-expression of the third and seventh spacers in the 
      CRISPR I region or third and sixth spacers in the CRISPR II region effectively 
      reduced phage P1 titres in the CRISPR deletion mutants. These results demonstrate 
      a novel regulatory mechanism for cas repression by CRP and provide evidence that 
      endogenous spacers can repress phage P1 replication in E. coli.

TI  - Interplay of transcriptional and small RNA-dependent control mechanisms regulates 
      chitosugar uptake in Escherichia coli and Salmonella.
PG  - 648-58
LID - 10.1111/mmi.12573 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli and Salmonella can use chitin-derived oligosaccharides as carbon 
      and nitrogen sources. Chitosugars traverse the outer membrane through a dedicated 
      chitoporin, ChiP, and are transported across the cytoplasmic membrane by the 
      chitobiose transporter (ChbBCA). Previous work revealed that synthesis of the 
      chitoporin, ChiP, requires transcription of the chbBCARFG operon. A sequence from 
      the chbBC portion of the transcript was shown to act as a decoy target for a 
      regulatory small RNA, ChiX, that normally blocks chiP expression. ChiX is 
      destabilized and degraded upon pairing with chbBC RNA. Here, we show that the 
      chiP gene, like the chbBCARFG operon, is also downregulated at the 
      transcriptional level by the NagC repressor. NagC repression is critical in 
      maintaining chiP mRNA levels low enough, relative to ChiX, to allow full 
      silencing by this sRNA. We also show that pairing of ChiX to chbBC RNA 
      downregulates chbC under uninduced conditions, that is, when ChiX is in excess to 
      the decoy sequence. Hence, under these conditions, chbBC RNA is not just a decoy, 
      but a true target of ChiX regulation. Altogether these findings underscore the 
      importance of stoichiometry in dictating the strength of the sRNA response and in 
      differentiating the regulator from the regulatory target.

AB  - Escherichia coli cyclic-AMP receptor protein (CRP) represents one of the 
      paradigms of bacterial gene regulation. Yet despite decades of intensive study, 
      new information continues to emerge that prompts reassessment of this classic 
      regulatory system. Moreover, in recent years CRPs from several other bacterial 
      species have been characterized, allowing the general applicability of the CRP 
      paradigm to be tested. Here the properties of the E. coli, Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis and Pseudomonas putida CRPs are considered in the context of the 
      ecological niches occupied by these bacteria. It appears that the cyclic-AMP-CRP 
      regulatory system has been adapted to respond to distinct external and internal 
      inputs across a broad sensitivity range that is, at least in part, determined by 
      bacterial lifestyles.

TI  - Cyclic AMP receptor protein regulates cspD, a bacterial toxin gene, in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1569-77
LID - 10.1128/JB.01476-13 [doi]
AB  - cspD, a member of cspA family of cold shock genes in Escherichia coli, is not 
      induced during cold shock. Its expression is induced during stationary phase. 
      CspD inhibits DNA replication, and a high level of the protein is toxic to cells. 
      Recently, CspD was proposed to be associated with persister cell formation in E. 
      coli. Here, we show that cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) upregulates cspD 
      transcription. Sequence analysis of the cspD upstream region revealed two tandem 
      CRP target sites, CRP site-I (the proximal site centered at -83.5 with respect to 
      the transcription start) and CRP site-II (the distal site centered at -112.5). 
      The results from electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that CRP indeed 
      binds to these two target sites in PcspD. The promoter-proximal CRP target site 
      was found to play a major role in PcspD activation by CRP, as studied by 
      transcriptional fusions carrying mutations in the target sites. The results from 
      in vitro transcription assays demonstrated that CRP activates PcspD transcription 
      in the absence of additional factors other than RNA polymerase. The requirement 
      for activating region 1 of CRP in PcspD activation, along with the involvement of 
      the 287, 265, and 261 determinants of the α-CTD, suggest that CRP activates by a 
      class I-type mechanism. However, only moderate activation in vitro was observed 
      compared to high activation in vivo, suggesting there might be additional 
      activators of PcspD. Overall, our findings show that CRP, a global metabolic 
      regulator in E. coli, activates a gene potentially related to persistence.

TI  - A novel indirect sequence readout component in the E. coli cyclic AMP receptor 
      protein operator.
PG  - 752-60
LID - 10.1021/cb4008309 [doi]
AB  - The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) from Escherichia coli has been extensively 
      studied for several decades. In particular, a detailed characterization of CRP 
      interaction with DNA has been obtained. The CRP dimer recognizes a consensus 
      sequence AANTGTGANNNNNNTCACANTT through direct amino acid nucleobase interactions 
      in the major groove of the two operator half-sites. Crystal structure analyses 
      have revealed that the interaction results in two strong kinks at the TG/CA steps 
      closest to the 6-base-pair spacer (N6). This spacer exhibits high sequence 
      variability among the more than 100 natural binding sites in the E. coli genome, 
      but the exact role of the N6 region in CRP interaction has not previously been 
      systematic examined. Here we employ an in vitro selection system based on a 
      randomized N6 spacer region to demonstrate that CRP binding to the lacP1 site may 
      be enhanced up to 14-fold or abolished by varying the N6 spacer sequences. 
      Furthermore, on the basis of sequence analysis and uranyl (UO2(2+)) probing data, 
      we propose that the underlying mechanism relies on N6 deformability.

AB  - Allostery is a fundamental process by which ligand binding to a protein alters 
      its activity at a distinct site. There is growing evidence that allosteric 
      cooperativity can be communicated by modulation of protein dynamics without 
      conformational change. The mechanisms, however, for communicating dynamic 
      fluctuations between sites are debated. We provide a foundational theory for how 
      allostery can occur as a function of low-frequency dynamics without a change in 
      structure. We have generated coarse-grained models that describe the protein 
      backbone motions of the CRP/FNR family transcription factors, CAP of Escherichia 
      coli and GlxR of Corynebacterium glutamicum. The latter we demonstrate as a new 
      exemplar for allostery without conformation change. We observe that binding the 
      first molecule of cAMP ligand is correlated with modulation of the global normal 
      modes and negative cooperativity for binding the second cAMP ligand without a 
      change in mean structure. The theory makes key experimental predictions that are 
      tested through an analysis of variant proteins by structural biology and 
      isothermal calorimetry. Quantifying allostery as a free energy landscape revealed 
      a protein "design space" that identified the inter- and intramolecular regulatory 
      parameters that frame CRP/FNR family allostery. Furthermore, through analyzing 
      CAP variants from diverse species, we demonstrate an evolutionary selection 
      pressure to conserve residues crucial for allosteric control. This finding 
      provides a link between the position of CRP/FNR transcription factors within the 
      allosteric free energy landscapes and evolutionary selection pressures. Our study 
      therefore reveals significant features of the mechanistic basis for allostery. 
      Changes in low-frequency dynamics correlate with allosteric effects on ligand 
      binding without the requirement for a defined spatial pathway. In addition to 
      evolving suitable three-dimensional structures, CRP/FNR family transcription 
      factors have been selected to occupy a dynamic space that fine-tunes biological 
      activity and thus establishes the means to engineer allosteric mechanisms driven 
      by low-frequency dynamics.

AB  - FeaR is an AraC family regulator that activates transcription of the tynA and 
      feaB genes in Escherichia coli. TynA is a periplasmic topaquinone- and 
      copper-containing amine oxidase, and FeaB is a cytosolic NAD-linked aldehyde 
      dehydrogenase. Phenylethylamine, tyramine, and dopamine are oxidized by TynA to 
      the corresponding aldehydes, releasing one equivalent of H2O2 and NH3. The 
      aldehydes can be oxidized to carboxylic acids by FeaB, and (in the case of 
      phenylacetate) can be further degraded to enter central metabolism. Thus, 
      phenylethylamine can be used as a carbon and nitrogen source, while tyramine and 
      dopamine can be used only as sources of nitrogen. Using genetic, biochemical and 
      computational approaches, we show that the FeaR binding site is a TGNCA-N8-AAA 
      motif that occurs in 2 copies in the tynA and feaB promoters. We show that the 
      coactivator for FeaR is the product rather than the substrate of the TynA 
      reaction. The feaR gene is upregulated by carbon or nitrogen limitation, which we 
      propose reflects regulation of feaR by the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) and 
      the nitrogen assimilation control protein (NAC), respectively. In carbon-limited 
      cells grown in the presence of a TynA substrate, tynA and feaB are induced, 
      whereas in nitrogen-limited cells, only the tynA promoter is induced. We propose 
      that tynA and feaB expression is finely tuned to provide the FeaB activity that 
      is required for carbon source utilization and the TynA activity required for 
      nitrogen and carbon source utilization.

TI  - Coordination of bacterial proteome with metabolism by cyclic AMP signalling.

AB  - The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression effect in Escherichia coli 
      is among the most intensely studied regulatory processes in biology. However, the 
      physiological function(s) of cAMP signalling and its molecular triggers remain 
      elusive. Here we use a quantitative physiological approach to show that cAMP 
      signalling tightly coordinates the expression of catabolic proteins with 
      biosynthetic and ribosomal proteins, in accordance with the cellular metabolic 
      needs during exponential growth. The expression of carbon catabolic genes 
      increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, 
      but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or 
      sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the 
      opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained 
      mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and 
      predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A 
      scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling 
      by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key 
      physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that 
      proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in 
      different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of 
      quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex 
      molecular signalling networks.

AB  - Properties of putrescine uptake by PotFGHI and PuuP and their physiological 
      significance were studied using a polyamine biosynthesis and uptake deficient 
      Escherichia coli KK3131 transformed with pACYC184 containing potFGHI or puuP. 
      Putrescine uptake activity of E. coli KK3131 transformed with pACYC184-PotFGHI 
      was higher than that of E. coli 3131 transformed with pACYC-PuuP when cells were 
      cultured in the absence of putrescine. Putrescine uptake by PotFGHI was both ATP 
      and membrane potential dependent, while that by PuuP was membrane potential 
      dependent. Feedback inhibition by polyamines occurred at the PotFGHI uptake 
      system but not at the PuuP uptake system. Expression of PuuP was reduced in the 
      presence of PuuR, a negative regulator for PuuP, and expression of PuuR was 
      positively regulated by glucose, which reduces the level of cAMP. The complex of 
      cAMP and CRP (cAMP receptor protein) inhibited the expression of PuuR in the 
      absence of glucose. Thus, the growth rate of E. coli KK3131 in the presence of 
      both 0.4% (22.2 mM) glucose and 10 mM putrescine was in the order of cells 
      transformed with pACYC-PotFGHI > pACYC-PuuP > pACYC-PuuP + PuuR, which was 
      parallel with the polyamine content in cells. The results indicate that PotFGHI 
      is necessary for rapid cell growth in the presence of glucose as an energy 
      source. When glucose in medium was depleted, however, PuuP was absolutely 
      necessary for cell growth in the presence of putrescine, because accumulation of 
      putrescine to a high level by PuuP was necessary for utilization of putrescine as 
      an energy source.

AB  - The Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is a well known 
      transcription activator protein. In this study, CRP was overexpressed, purified 
      and cocrystallized with cAMP and a 38 bp full-length double-stranded DNA 
      fragment. The full-length segment differed from the half-site fragments used in 
      previous crystallization experiments and is more similar to the environment in 
      vivo. CRP-cAMP-DNA crystals were obtained and diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution. The 
      crystals belonged to space group P3121, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 76.03, 
      c = 144.00 Å. The asymmetric unit was found to contain one protein molecule and 
      half a 38 bp full-length double-stranded DNA fragment, with a Matthews 
      coefficient of 2.62 Å(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 53.14%.

TI  - Involvement of cyclic AMP receptor protein in regulation of the rmf gene encoding 
      the ribosome modulation factor in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 2212-9
LID - 10.1128/JB.02279-12 [doi]
AB  - The decrease in overall translation in stationary-phase Escherichia coli is 
      accompanied with the formation of functionally inactive 100S ribosomes mediated 
      by the ribosome modulation factor (RMF). At present, however, little is known 
      regarding the regulation of stationary-phase-coupled RMF expression. In the 
      course of a systematic screening of regulation targets of DNA-binding 
      transcription factors from E. coli, we realized that CRP (cyclic AMP [cAMP] 
      receptor protein), the global regulator for carbon source utilization, 
      participates in regulation of some ribosomal protein genes, including the rmf 
      gene. In this study, we carried out detailed analysis of the regulation of the 
      RMF gene by cAMP-CRP. The cAMP-dependent binding of CRP to the rmf gene promoter 
      was confirmed by gel shift and DNase I footprinting assays. By using a reporter 
      assay system, the expression level of RMF was found to decrease in the crp 
      knockout mutant, indicating the involvement of CRP as an activator of the rmf 
      promoter. In good agreement with the reduction of rmf promoter activity, we 
      observed decreases in RMF production and 100S ribosome dimerization in the 
      absence of CRP. Taken together, we propose that CRP regulates transcription 
      activation of the rmf gene for formation of 100S ribosome dimers. Physiological 
      roles of CRP involvement in RMF production are discussed.

TI  - Crosstalk of Escherichia coli FadR with global regulators in expression of fatty 
      acid transport genes.
PG  - e46275
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0046275 [doi]
LID - e46275
AB  - Escherichia coli FadR plays two regulatory roles in fatty acid metabolism. FadR 
      represses the fatty acid degradation (fad) system and activates the unsaturated 
      fatty acid synthetic pathway. Cross-talk between E. coli FadR and the ArcA-ArcB 
      oxygen-responsive two-component system was observed that resulted in diverse 
      regulation of certain fad regulon β-oxidation genes. We have extended such 
      analyses to the fadL and fadD genes, the protein products of which are required 
      for long chain fatty acid transport and have also studied the role of a third 
      global regulator, the CRP-cAMP complex. The promoters of both the fadL and fadD 
      genes contain two experimentally validated FadR-binding sites plus binding sites 
      for ArcA and CRP-cAMP. Despite the presence of dual binding sites FadR only 
      modestly regulates expression of these genes, indicating that the number of 
      binding sites does not determine regulatory strength. We report complementary in 
      vitro and in vivo studies indicating that the CRP-cAMP complex directly activates 
      expression of fadL and fadD as well as the β-oxidation gene, fadH. The 
      physiological relevance of the fadL and fadD transcription data was validated by 
      direct assays of long chain fatty acid transport.

TI  - Comparative genomics of CytR, an unusual member of the LacI family of 
      transcription factors.
PG  - e44194
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0044194 [doi]
LID - e44194
AB  - CytR is a transcription regulator from the LacI family, present in some 
      gamma-proteobacteria including Escherichia coli and known not only for its 
      cellular role, control of transport and utilization of nucleosides, but for a 
      number of unusual structural properties. The present study addressed three 
      related problems: structure of CytR-binding sites and motifs, their evolutionary 
      conservation, and identification of new members of the CytR regulon. While the 
      majority of CytR-binding sites are imperfect inverted repeats situated between 
      binding sites for another transcription factor, CRP, other architectures were 
      observed, in particular, direct repeats. While the similarity between sites for 
      different genes in one genome is rather low, and hence the consensus motif is 
      weak, there is high conservation of orthologous sites in different genomes 
      (mainly in the Enterobacteriales) arguing for the presence of specific CytR-DNA 
      contacts. On larger evolutionary distances candidate CytR sites may migrate but 
      the approximate distance between flanking CRP sites tends to be conserved, which 
      demonstrates that the overall structure of the CRP-CytR-DNA complex is 
      gene-specific. The analysis yielded candidate CytR-binding sites for orthologs of 
      known regulon members in less studied genomes of the Enterobacteriales and 
      Vibrionales and identified a new candidate member of the CytR regulon, encoding a 
      transporter named NupT (YcdZ).

TI  - Regulatory role of cAMP receptor protein over Escherichia coli fumarase genes.
PG  - 426-33
LID - 10.1007/s12275-012-1542-6 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli expresses three fumarase genes, namely, fumA, fumB, and fumC. In 
      the present study, catabolite repression was observed in the fumA-lacZ and 
      fumC-lacZ fusion strains, but not in the fumB-lacZ fusion strain. The Crp-binding 
      sites in fumA and fumC were identified using an electrophoretic mobility shift 
      assay and footprint analysis. However, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
      did not detect band shifts in fumB. Fnr and ArcA serve as transcription 
      regulators of fumarase gene expression. In relation to this, different mutants, 
      including Δcya, Δcrp, Δfnr, and ΔarcA, were used to explore the regulatory role 
      of Crp over fumA and fumC. The results show that Crp is an activator of fumA and 
      fumC gene expression under various oxygen conditions and growth rates. ArcA was 
      identified as the dominant repressor, with the major repression occurring at 0-4% 
      oxygen. In addition, Fnr was confirmed as a repressor of fumC for the first time. 
      This study elucidates the effects of Crp on fumarase gene expression.

TI  - First insights into the unexplored two-component system YehU/YehT in Escherichia 
      coli.
PG  - 4272-84
LID - 10.1128/JB.00409-12 [doi]
AB  - Two-component systems (TCSs) consisting of a membrane-anchored histidine kinase 
      (HK) and a response regulator (RR) with DNA-binding activity. are major players 
      in signal transduction in prokaryotes. Whereas most TCSs in Escherichia coli are 
      well characterized, almost nothing is known about the LytS-like HK YehU and the 
      corresponding LytTR-like RR YehT. To identify YehT-regulated genes, we compared 
      the transcriptomes of E. coli cells overproducing either YehT or the RR KdpE 
      (control). The expression levels of 32 genes differed more than 8-fold between 
      the two strains. A comprehensive evaluation of these genes identified yjiY as a 
      target of YehT. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified YehT 
      confirmed that YehT interacts directly with the yjiY promoter. Specifically, YehT 
      binds to two direct repeats of the motif ACC(G/A)CT(C/T)A separated by a 13-bp 
      spacer in the yjiY promoter. The target gene yjiY encodes an inner membrane 
      protein belonging to the CstA superfamily of transporters. In E. coli cells 
      growing in media containing peptides or amino acids as a carbon source, yjiY is 
      strongly induced at the onset of the stationary-growth phase. Moreover, 
      expression was found to be dependent on cyclic AMP (cAMP)/cAMP receptor protein 
      (CRP). It is suggested that YehU/YehT participates in the stationary-phase 
      control network.

TI  - A small RNA that regulates motility and biofilm formation in response to changes 
      in nutrient availability in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 17-35
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2012.07965.x [doi]
AB  - In bacteria, many small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are induced in response to 
      specific environmental signals or stresses and act by base-pairing with mRNA 
      targets to affect protein translation or mRNA stability. In Escherichia coli, the 
      gene for the sRNA IS061/IsrA, here renamed McaS, was predicted to reside in an 
      intergenic region between abgR, encoding a transcription regulator and ydaL, 
      encoding a small MutS-related protein. We show that McaS is a ∼95nt transcript 
      whose expression increases over growth, peaking in early-to-mid stationary phase, 
      or when glucose is limiting. McaS uses three discrete single-stranded regions to 
      regulate mRNA targets involved in various aspects of biofilm formation. McaS 
      represses csgD, the transcription regulator of curli biogenesis and activates 
      flhD, the master transcription regulator of flagella synthesis leading to 
      increased motility, a process not previously reported to be regulated by sRNAs. 
      McaS also regulates pgaA, a porin required for the export of the polysaccharide 
      poly β-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Consequently, high levels of McaS result in 
      increased biofilm formation while a strain lacking mcaS shows reduced biofilm 
      formation. Based on our observations, we propose that, in response to limited 
      nutrient availability, increasing levels of McaS modulate steps in the 
      progression to a sessile lifestyle.

TI  - Random mutagenesis of global transcription factor cAMP receptor protein for 
      improved osmotolerance.
PG  - 1165-72

AB  - The naturally existing microbial hosts can rarely satisfy industrial 
      requirements, thus there has always been an intense effort in strain engineering 
      to meet the needs of these bioprocesses. Here, in this work, we want to prove the 
      concept that engineering global transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 
      of Escherichia coli can improve cell phenotypes. CRP is one of the global 
      regulatory proteins that can regulate the transcription of over 400 genes in E. 
      coli. The target phenotype in this study is strain osmotolerance. Amino acid 
      mutations were introduced to CRP by either error-prone PCR or DNA shuffling, and 
      the random mutagenesis libraries were subjected to enrichment selection under 
      NaCl stress. Five CRP mutants (MT1-MT5) were selected from the error-prone PCR 
      libraries with enhanced osmotolerance. DNA shuffling technique was employed to 
      generate mutant MT6 with MT1-MT5 as templates. All of these variants showed much 
      better growth in the presence of NaCl compared to the wild type, and MT6 
      presented the best tolerance towards NaCl. In the presence of 0.9 M NaCl, the 
      growth rate of MT6 is 0.113 h(-1), while that of WT is 0.077 h(-1). MT6 also 
      exhibited resistance to other osmotic stressors, such as KCl, glucose, and 
      sucrose. DNA microarray analysis showed that genes involved in colanic acid 
      biosynthesis are up-regulated in the absence of salt stress, whereas carbohydrate 
      metabolic genes are differentially expressed under NaCl stress when comparing MT6 
      to WT. Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed the elongation of both WT 
      and MT6 when exposed to NaCl but the cell surface of MT6 was relatively smooth.

TI  - CitA/CitB two-component system regulating citrate fermentation in Escherichia 
      coli and its relation to the DcuS/DcuR system in vivo.
PG  - 636-45
LID - 10.1128/JB.06345-11 [doi]
AB  - Citrate fermentation by Escherichia coli requires the function of the 
      citrate/succinate antiporter CitT (citT gene) and of citrate lyase (citCDEFXG 
      genes). Earlier experiments suggested that the two-component system CitA/CitB, 
      consisting of the membrane-bound sensor kinase CitA and the response regulator 
      CitB, stimulates the expression of the genes in the presence of citrate, 
      similarly to CitA/CitB of Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this study, the expression of 
      a chromosomal citC-lacZ gene fusion was shown to depend on CitA/CitB and citrate. 
      CitA/CitB is related to the DcuS/DcuR two-component system which induces the 
      expression of genes for fumarate respiration in response to C(4)-dicarboxylates 
      and citrate. Unlike DcuS, CitA required none of the cognate transporters (CitT, 
      DcuB, or DcuC) for function, and the deletion of the corresponding genes showed 
      no effect on the expression of citC-lacZ. The citAB operon is preceded by a DcuR 
      binding site. Phosphorylated DcuR bound specifically to the promoter region, and 
      the deletion of dcuS or dcuR reduced the expression of citC. The data indicate 
      the presence of a regulatory cascade consisting of DcuS/DcuR modulating citAB 
      expression (and CitA/CitB levels) and CitA/CitB controlling the expression of the 
      citCDEFXGT gene cluster in response to citrate. In vivo fluorescence resonance 
      energy transfer (FRET) and the bacterial two-hybrid system (BACTH) showed 
      interaction between the DcuS and CitA proteins. However, BACTH and expression 
      studies demonstrated the lack of interaction and cross-regulation between CitA 
      and DcuR or DcuS and CitB. Therefore, there is only linear phosphoryl transfer 
      (DcuS→DcuR and CitA→CitB) without cross-regulation between DcuS/DcuR and 
      CitA/CitB.

AB  - Lysine acetylation is a well-established post-translational modification widely 
      conserved and distributed in bacteria. Although multiple regulatory roles have 
      been proved, little is known about its regulation. Here, we present evidence that 
      the transcription of the Gcn5-like acetyltransferase YfiQ of Escherichia coli 
      (proposed name: PatZ) is regulated by cAMP-CRP and its implications on acetate 
      metabolism regulation. The acetate scavenging acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs) is 
      regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. 
      Post-translational regulation depends on a protein acetyltransferase (yfiQ) and 
      an NAD(+) -dependent deacetylase (cobB). We have studied their expression under 
      different environmental conditions. cobB is constitutively expressed from a 
      promoter located upstream nagK. The expression of yfiQ occurs from its own 
      promoter; it is upregulated in the stationary phase and in the presence of 
      non-PTS carbon sources and is positively regulated by cAMP-CRP. Two putative CRP 
      binding sites are necessary for its full activity. Gene deletion revealed that 
      cobB is essential for growth on acetate, yfiQ deletion restoring growth of the 
      cobB mutant. The fine tuning of metabolic enzymes results from the integration of 
      multiple mechanisms, and redundant systems may exist. Despite the existence of 
      divergent catabolite repression systems, this may be a conserved strategy common 
      to both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

TI  - Cyclic AMP receptor protein regulates cspE, an early cold-inducible gene, in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 6142-51
LID - 10.1128/JB.05728-11 [doi]
AB  - cspE, a member of the cspA family of cold shock proteins in Escherichia coli, is 
      an early cold-inducible protein. The nucleic acid melting ability and 
      transcription antiterminator activity of CspE have been reported to be critical 
      for growth at low temperature. Here, we show that the cyclic AMP receptor protein 
      (CRP), a global regulator involved in sugar metabolism, upregulates cspE in E. 
      coli. Sequence analysis of the cspE upstream region revealed a putative CRP 
      target site centered at -61.5 relative to the transcription start. The binding of 
      CRP to this target site was demonstrated using electrophoretic mobility shift 
      assays. The presence of this site was shown to be essential for P(cspE) 
      activation by CRP. Mutational analysis of the binding site indicated that the 
      presence of an intact second core motif is more important than the first core 
      motif for CRP-P(cspE) interaction. Based on the promoter architecture, we 
      classified P(cspE) as a class I CRP-dependent promoter. This was further 
      substantiated by our data demonstrating the involvement of the AR1 domain of CRP 
      in P(cspE) transcription. Furthermore, the substitutions in the key residues of 
      the RNA polymerase α-subunit C-terminal domain (α-CTD), which are important for 
      class I CRP-dependent transcription, showed the involvement of 265 and 287 
      determinants in P(cspE) transcription. In addition, the deletion of crp led to a 
      growth defect at low temperature, suggesting that CRP plays an important role in 
      cold adaptation.

TI  - Negative effect of glucose on ompA mRNA stability: a potential role of cyclic AMP 
      in the repression of hfq in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5833-40
LID - 10.1128/JB.05359-11 [doi]
AB  - Glucose is a carbon source that is capable of modulating the level of cyclic AMP 
      (cAMP)-regulated genes. In the present study, we found that the stability of ompA 
      mRNA was reduced in Escherichia coli when glucose (40 mM) was present in 
      Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. This effect was associated with a low level of cAMP 
      induced by the glucose. The results were confirmed with an adenylyl cyclase 
      mutant with low levels of cAMP that are not modulated by glucose. Northern blot 
      and Western blot analyses revealed that the host factor I (Hfq) (both mRNA and 
      protein) levels were downregulated in the presence of cAMP. Furthermore, we 
      showed that a complex of cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and cAMP binds to a specific 
      P3(hfq) promoter region of hfq and regulates hfq expression. The regulation of 
      the hfq gene was confirmed in vivo using an hfq-deficient mutant transformed with 
      an exogenous hfq gene containing the promoter. These results demonstrated that 
      expression of hfq was repressed by the CRP-cAMP complex. The presence of glucose 
      resulted in increased Hfq protein levels, which decreased ompA mRNA stability. An 
      additional experiment showed that cAMP also increased the stability of fur mRNA. 
      Taken together, these results suggested that the repression of Hfq by cAMP may 
      contribute to the stability of other mRNA in E. coli.

AB  - CRP (cAMP receptor protein), the global regulator of genes for carbon source 
      utilization in the absence of glucose, is the best-studied prokaryotic 
      transcription factor. A total of 195 target promoters on the Escherichia coli 
      genome have been proposed to be under the control of cAMP-bound CRP. Using the 
      newly developed Genomic SELEX screening system of transcription factor-binding 
      sequences, however, we have identified a total of at least 254 CRP-binding sites. 
      Based on their location on the E. coli genome, we predict a total of at least 183 
      novel regulation target operons, altogether with the 195 hitherto known targets, 
      reaching to the minimum of 378 promoters as the regulation targets of cAMP-CRP. 
      All the promoters selected from the newly identified targets and examined by 
      using the lacZ reporter assay were found to be under the control of CRP, 
      indicating that the Genomic SELEX screening allowed to identify the CRP targets 
      with high accuracy. Based on the functions of novel target genes, we conclude 
      that CRP plays a key regulatory role in the whole processes from the selective 
      transport of carbon sources, the glycolysis-gluconeogenesis switching to the 
      metabolisms downstream of glycolysis, including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, 
      pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) pathway and aerobic respiration. One unique 
      regulation mode is that a single and the same CRP molecule bound within 
      intergenic regions often regulates both of divergently transcribed operons.

TI  - Escherichia coli mhpR gene expression is regulated by catabolite repression 
      mediated by the cAMP-CRP complex.
PG  - 593-600
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.043620-0 [doi]
AB  - The expression of the mhp genes involved in the degradation of the aromatic 
      compound 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (3HPP) in Escherichia coli is 
      dependent on the MhpR transcriptional activator at the Pa promoter. This 
      catabolic promoter is also subject to catabolic repression in the presence of 
      glucose mediated by the cAMP-CRP complex. The Pr promoter drives the 
      MhpR-independent expression of the regulatory gene. In vivo and in vitro 
      experiments have shown that transcription from the Pr promoter is downregulated 
      by the addition of glucose and this catabolic repression is also mediated by the 
      cAMP-CRP complex. The activation role of the cAMP-CRP regulatory system was 
      further investigated by DNase I footprinting assays, which showed that the 
      cAMP-CRP complex binds to the Pr promoter sequence, protecting a region centred 
      at position -40.5, which allowed the classification of Pr as a class II 
      CRP-dependent promoter. Open complex formation at the Pr promoter is observed 
      only when RNA polymerase and cAMP-CRP are present. Finally, by in vitro 
      transcription assays we have demonstrated the absolute requirement of the 
      cAMP-CRP complex for the activation of the Pr promoter.

TI  - BglJ-RcsB heterodimers relieve repression of the Escherichia coli bgl operon by 
      H-NS.
PG  - 6456-64
LID - 10.1128/JB.00807-10 [doi]
AB  - RcsB is the response regulator of the complex Rcs two-component system, which 
      senses perturbations in the outer membrane and peptidoglycan layer. BglJ is a 
      transcriptional regulator whose constitutive expression causes activation of the 
      H-NS- and StpA-repressed bgl (aryl-β,D-glucoside) operon in Escherichia coli. 
      RcsB and BglJ both belong to the LuxR-type family of transcriptional regulators 
      with a characteristic C-terminal DNA-binding domain. Here, we show that BglJ and 
      RcsB interact and form heterodimers that presumably bind upstream of the bgl 
      promoter, as suggested by mutation of a sequence motif related to the consensus 
      sequence for RcsA-RcsB heterodimers. Heterodimerization of BglJ-RcsB and relief 
      of H-NS-mediated repression of bgl by BglJ-RcsB are apparently independent of 
      RcsB phosphorylation. In addition, we show that LeuO, a pleiotropic LysR-type 
      transcriptional regulator, likewise binds to the bgl upstream regulatory region 
      and relieves repression of bgl independently of BglJ-RcsB. Thus, LeuO can affect 
      bgl directly, as shown here, and indirectly by activating the H-NS-repressed 
      yjjQ-bglJ operon, as shown previously. Taken together, heterodimer formation of 
      RcsB and BglJ expands the role of the Rcs two-component system and the network of 
      regulators affecting the bgl promoter.

TI  - Theoretical and empirical quality assessment of transcription factor-binding 
      motifs.
PG  - 808-24
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkq710 [doi]
AB  - Position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) are routinely used to predict 
      transcription factor (TF)-binding sites in genome sequences. However, their 
      reliability to predict novel binding sites can be far from optimum, due to the 
      use of a small number of training sites or the inappropriate choice of parameters 
      when building the matrix or when scanning sequences with it. Measures of matrix 
      quality such as E-value and information content rely on theoretical models, and 
      may fail in the context of full genome sequences. We propose a method, 
      implemented in the program 'matrix-quality', that combines theoretical and 
      empirical score distributions to assess reliability of PSSMs for predicting 
      TF-binding sites. We applied 'matrix-quality' to estimate the predictive capacity 
      of matrices for bacterial, yeast and mouse TFs. The evaluation of matrices from 
      RegulonDB revealed some poorly predictive motifs, and allowed us to quantify the 
      improvements obtained by applying multi-genome motif discovery. Interestingly, 
      the method reveals differences between global and specific regulators. It also 
      highlights the enrichment of binding sites in sequence sets obtained from 
      high-throughput ChIP-chip (bacterial and yeast TFs), and ChIP-seq and experiments 
      (mouse TFs). The method presented here has many applications, including: 
      selecting reliable motifs before scanning sequences; improving motif collections 
      in TFs databases; evaluating motifs discovered using high-throughput data sets.

TI  - Overlapping repressor binding sites result in additive regulation of Escherichia 
      coli FadH by FadR and ArcA.
PG  - 4289-99
LID - 10.1128/JB.00516-10 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli fadH encodes a 2,4-dienoyl reductase that plays an auxiliary 
      role in beta-oxidation of certain unsaturated fatty acids. In the 2 decades since 
      its discovery, FadH biochemistry has been studied extensively. However, the 
      genetic regulation of FadH has been explored only partially. Here we report 
      mapping of the fadH promoter and document its complex regulation by three 
      independent regulators, the fatty acid degradation FadR repressor, the 
      oxygen-responsive ArcA-ArcB two-component system, and the cyclic AMP receptor 
      protein-cyclic AMP (CRP-cAMP) complex. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays 
      demonstrated that FadR binds to the fadH promoter region and that this binding 
      can be specifically reversed by long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters. In 
      vivo data combining transcriptional lacZ fusion and real-time quantitative PCR 
      (qPCR) analyses indicated that fadH is strongly repressed by FadR, in agreement 
      with induction of fadH by long-chain fatty acids. Inactivation of arcA increased 
      fadH transcription by >3-fold under anaerobic conditions. Moreover, fadH 
      expression was increased 8- to 10-fold under anaerobic conditions upon deletion 
      of both the fadR and the arcA gene, indicating that anaerobic expression is 
      additively repressed by FadR and ArcA-ArcB. Unlike fadM, a newly reported member 
      of the E. coli fad regulon that encodes another auxiliary beta-oxidation enzyme, 
      fadH was activated by the CRP-cAMP complex in a manner similar to those of the 
      prototypical fad genes. In the absence of the CRP-cAMP complex, repression of 
      fadH expression by both FadR and ArcA-ArcB was very weak, suggesting a possible 
      interplay with other DNA binding proteins.

TI  - Many chromosomal genes modulate MarA-mediated multidrug resistance in Escherichia 
      coli.
PG  - 2125-34
LID - 10.1128/AAC.01420-09 [doi]
AB  - Multidrug resistance (MDR) in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli can be 
      associated with overexpression of marA, a transcription factor that upregulates 
      multidrug efflux and downregulates membrane permeability. Using random 
      transposome mutagenesis, we found that many chromosomal genes and environmental 
      stimuli affected MarA-mediated antibiotic resistance. Seven genes affected 
      resistance mediated by MarA in an antibiotic-specific way; these were mostly 
      genes encoding unrelated enzymes, transporters, and unknown proteins. Other genes 
      affected MarA-mediated resistance to all antibiotics tested. These genes were 
      acrA, acrB, and tolC (which encode the major MarA-regulated multidrug efflux pump 
      AcrAB-TolC), crp, cyaA, hns, and pcnB (four genes involved in global regulation 
      of gene expression), and the unknown gene damX. The last five genes affected 
      MarA-mediated MDR by altering marA expression or MarA function specifically on 
      acrA. These findings demonstrate that MarA-mediated MDR is regulated at multiple 
      levels by different genes and stimuli, which makes it both complex and fine-tuned 
      and interconnects it with global cell regulation and metabolism. Such a 
      regulation could contribute to the adaptation and spread of MDR strains and may 
      be targeted to treat antibiotic-resistant E. coli and related pathogens.

AB  - Random mutagenesis has been used to identify the target DNA sites for the MalI 
      repressor at the divergent Escherichia coli K-12 malX-malI promoters. The malX 
      promoter is repressed by MalI binding to a DNA site located from position -24 to 
      position -9, upstream of the malX promoter transcript start. The malI promoter is 
      repressed by MalI binding from position +3 to position +18, downstream of the 
      malI transcript start. MalI binding at the malI promoter target is not required 
      for repression of the malX promoter. Similarly, MalI binding at the malX promoter 
      target is not required for repression of the malI. Although the malX and malI 
      promoters are regulated by a single DNA site for cyclic AMP receptor protein, 
      they function independently and each is repressed by MalI binding to a different 
      independent operator site.

TI  - Activation of sigma 28-dependent transcription in Escherichia coli by the cyclic 
      AMP receptor protein requires an unusual promoter organization.
PG  - 1098-111
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2009.06913.x [doi]
AB  - The Escherichia coli aer regulatory region contains a single promoter that is 
      recognized by RNA polymerase containing the flagellar sigma factor, sigma(28). 
      Expression from this promoter is dependent on direct activation by the cyclic AMP 
      receptor protein, which binds to a target centred 49.5 base pairs upstream from 
      the transcript start. Activator-dependent transcription from the aer promoter was 
      reconstituted in vitro, and a tethered inorganic nuclease was used to find the 
      position of the C-terminal domains of the RNA polymerase alpha subunits in 
      transcriptionally competent open complexes. We report that the ternary 
      activator--RNA polymerase--aer promoter open complex is organized differently 
      from complexes at previously characterized promoters. Among other E. coli 
      promoters recognized by RNA polymerase containing sigma(28), only the trg 
      promoter is activated directly by the cyclic AMP receptor protein. The 
      organization of the different promoter elements and the activator binding site at 
      the trg promoter is the same as at the aer promoter, suggesting a common 
      activation mechanism.

TI  - Structure of apo-CAP reveals that large conformational changes are necessary for 
      DNA binding.
PG  - 16604-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0908380106 [doi]
AB  - The binding of cAMP to the Escherichia coli catabolite gene activator protein 
      (CAP) produces a conformational change that enables it to bind specific DNA 
      sequences and regulate transcription, which it cannot do in the absence of the 
      nucleotide. The crystal structures of the unliganded CAP containing a D138L 
      mutation and the unliganded WT CAP were determined at 2.3 and 3.6 A resolution, 
      respectively, and reveal that the two DNA binding domains have dimerized into one 
      rigid body and their two DNA recognition helices become buried. The WT structure 
      shows multiple orientations of this rigid body relative to the nucleotide binding 
      domain supporting earlier biochemical data suggesting that the inactive form 
      exists in an equilibrium among different conformations. Comparison of the 
      structures of the liganded and unliganded CAP suggests that cAMP stabilizes the 
      active DNA binding conformation of CAP through the interactions that the N(6) of 
      the adenosine makes with the C-helices. These interactions are associated with 
      the reorientation and elongation of the C-helices that precludes the formation of 
      the inactive structure.

TI  - Small stress response proteins in Escherichia coli: proteins missed by classical 
      proteomic studies.
PG  - 46-58
LID - 10.1128/JB.00872-09 [doi]
AB  - Proteins of 50 or fewer amino acids are poorly characterized in all organisms. 
      The corresponding genes are challenging to reliably annotate, and it is difficult 
      to purify and characterize the small protein products. Due to these technical 
      limitations, little is known about the abundance of small proteins, not to 
      mention their biological functions. To begin to characterize these small proteins 
      in Escherichia coli, we assayed their accumulation under a variety of growth 
      conditions and after exposure to stress. We found that many small proteins 
      accumulate under specific growth conditions or are stress induced. For some 
      genes, the observed changes in protein levels were consistent with known 
      transcriptional regulation, such as ArcA activation of the operons encoding yccB 
      and ybgT. However, we also identified novel regulation, such as Zur repression of 
      ykgMO, cyclic AMP response protein (CRP) repression of azuC, and CRP activation 
      of ykgR. The levels of 11 small proteins increase after heat shock, and induction 
      of at least 1 of these, YobF, occurs at a posttranscriptional level. These 
      results show that small proteins are an overlooked subset of stress response 
      proteins in E. coli and provide information that will be valuable for determining 
      the functions of these proteins.

TI  - Transcriptional effects of CRP* expression in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/1754-1611-3-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli exhibits diauxic growth in sugar mixtures due to 
      CRP-mediated catabolite repression and inducer exclusion related to 
      phosphotransferase system enzyme activity. Replacement of the native crp gene 
      with a catabolite repression mutant (referred to as crp*) enables co-utilization 
      of glucose and other sugars in E. coli. While previous studies have examined the 
      effects of expressing CRP* mutants on the expression of specific catabolic genes, 
      little is known about the global transcriptional effects of CRP* expression. In 
      this study, we compare the transcriptome of E. coli W3110 (expressing wild-type 
      CRP) to that of mutant strain PC05 (expressing CRP*) in the presence and absence 
      of glucose. RESULTS: The glucose effect is significantly suppressed in strain 
      PC05 relative to strain W3110. The expression levels of glucose-sensitive genes 
      are generally not altered by glucose to the same extent in strain PCO5 as 
      compared to W3110. Only 23 of the 80 genes showing significant differential 
      expression in the presence of glucose for strain PC05 are present among the 418 
      genes believed to be directly regulated by CRP. Genes involved in central carbon 
      metabolism (including several TCA cycle genes) and amino acid biosynthesis, as 
      well as genes encoding nutrient transport systems are among those whose 
      transcript levels are most significantly affected by CRP* expression.We present a 
      detailed transcription analysis and relate these results to phenotypic 
      differences between strains expressing wild-type CRP and CRP*. Notably, CRP* 
      expression in the presence of glucose results in an elevated intracellular NADPH 
      concentration and reduced NADH concentration relative to wild-type CRP. 
      Meanwhile, a more drastic decrease in the NADPH/NADP+ ratio is observed for the 
      case of CRP* expression in strains engineered to reduce xylose to xylitol via a 
      heterologously expressed, NADPH-dependent xylose reductase. Altered expression 
      levels of transhydrogenase and TCA cycle genes, among others, are consistent with 
      these observations. CONCLUSION: While the simplest model of CRP*-mediated gene 
      expression assumes insensitivity to glucose (or cAMP), our results show that gene 
      expression in the context of CRP* is very different from that of wild-type in the 
      absence of glucose, and is influenced by the presence of glucose. Most of the 
      transcription changes in response to CRP* expression are difficult to interpret 
      in terms of possible systematic effects on metabolism. Elevated NADPH 
      availability resulting from CRP* expression suggests potential biocatalytic 
      applications of crp* strains that extend beyond relief of catabolite repression.

TI  - Participation of regulator AscG of the beta-glucoside utilization operon in 
      regulation of the propionate catabolism operon.
PG  - 6136-44
LID - 10.1128/JB.00663-09 [doi]
AB  - The asc operon of Escherichia coli is one of the cryptic genetic systems for 
      beta-D-galactoside utilization as a carbon source. The ascFB genes for 
      beta-D-galactoside transport and catabolism are repressed by the AscG regulator. 
      After genomic SELEX screening, AscG was found to recognize and bind the consensus 
      palindromic sequence TGAAACC-GGTTTCA. AscG binding was detected at two sites 
      upstream of the ascFB promoter and at three sites upstream of the prpBC operon 
      for propionate catabolism. In an ascG-disrupted mutant, transcription of ascFB 
      was enhanced, in agreement with the repressor model of AscG. This repression was 
      indicated to be due to interference of binding of cyclic AMP-CRP to the CRP box, 
      which overlaps with the AscG-binding site 1, as well as binding of RNA polymerase 
      to the promoter. Under conditions of steady-state E. coli growth in a rich 
      medium, the intracellular level of AscG stayed constant at a level supposedly 
      leading to tight repression of the ascFB operon. The level of prpR, encoding the 
      activator of prpBCDE, was also increased in the absence of AscG, indicating the 
      involvement of AscG in repression of prpR. Taken together, these data suggest a 
      metabolic link through interplay between the asc and prp operons.

TI  - Downregulation of the Escherichia coli guaB promoter by upstream-bound cyclic AMP 
      receptor protein.
PG  - 6094-104
LID - 10.1128/JB.00672-09 [doi]
AB  - The Escherichia coli guaB promoter (P(guaB)) is responsible for directing 
      transcription of the guaB and guaA genes, which specify the biosynthesis of the 
      nucleotide GMP. P(guaB) is subject to growth rate-dependent control (GRDC) and 
      possesses an UP element that is required for this regulation. In addition, 
      P(guaB) contains a discriminator, three binding sites for the nucleoid-associated 
      protein FIS, and putative binding sites for the regulatory proteins DnaA, PurR, 
      and cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP). Here we show that the CRP-cyclic AMP 
      (cAMP) complex binds to a site located over 100 bp upstream of the guaB 
      transcription start site, where it serves to downregulate P(guaB). The 
      CRP-mediated repression of P(guaB) activity increases in media that support lower 
      growth rates. Inactivation of the crp or cyaA gene or ablation/translocation of 
      the CRP site relieves repression by CRP and results in a loss of GRDC of P(guaB). 
      Thus, GRDC of P(guaB) involves a progressive increase in CRP-mediated repression 
      of the promoter as the growth rate decreases. Our results also suggest that the 
      CRP-cAMP complex does not direct GRDC at P(guaB) and that at least one other 
      regulatory factor is required for conferring GRDC on this promoter. However, PurR 
      and DnaA are not required for this regulatory mechanism.

TI  - Sxy induces a CRP-S regulon in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5180-95
LID - 10.1128/JB.00476-09 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli is not considered naturally competent, yet it has homologues of 
      the genes that most competent bacteria use for DNA uptake and processing. In 
      Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae, these genes are regulated by the Sxy 
      and cyclic AMP receptor (CRP) proteins. We used microarrays to find out whether 
      similar regulation occurs in E. coli. Expression of sxy strongly induced 63 
      transcriptional units, 34 of which required CRP for transcriptional activation 
      and had promoter sites resembling the Sxy- and CRP-dependent CRP-S motif 
      previously characterized in H. influenzae. As previously reported, sxy expression 
      also induced the sigma-H regulon. Flagellar operons were downregulated by sxy 
      expression, although motility remained unaffected. The CRP-S regulon included all 
      of E. coli's known competence gene homologues, so we investigated Sxy's effect on 
      competence-associated phenotypes. A sxy knockout reduced both "natural" plasmid 
      transformation and competitive fitness in long-term culture. In addition, 
      expression of plasmid-borne sxy led to production of type IV pilin, the main 
      subunit of the DNA uptake machinery of most bacteria. Although H. influenzae Sxy 
      only weakly activated the E. coli Sxy regulon, induction was dramatically 
      improved when it was coexpressed with its cognate CRP, suggesting that intimate 
      interactions between Sxy and CRP are required for transcriptional activation at 
      CRP-S sites.

TI  - Structural overview on the allosteric activation of cyclic AMP receptor protein.
PG  - 1299-308
LID - 10.1016/j.bbapap.2009.04.015 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is a prokaryotic global transcription regulator 
      that controls the expression of nearly 200 genes. The protein, allosterically 
      activated by cAMP binding, binds to DNA and interacts with RNA polymerase. 
      Current understanding on the allosteric process of the Escherichia coli CRP 
      activation can be summarized into a rigid-body movement that involves subunit 
      realignment and domain rearrangement. The main consequence of that overall 
      transition is protrusion and adjustment of F-helices that recognize specific DNA 
      sites. Although physicochemical and structural studies during the past decades 
      have contributed to a comprehensive understanding of the CRP allostery, a paucity 
      of structural information about the cAMP-free form (apo-CRP) has precluded a 
      definite elucidation of the allosterism. In this respect, recent achievements of 
      structures on other CRP-family proteins provide useful information to fill in the 
      details of the allosteric transition of CRP. Thus, in this paper, accomplishments 
      of CRP-family structures are summarized and inspected comparatively with new 
      findings. This review not only provides a structural overview on the allosteric 
      conformational change of CRP but also suggests a thoughtful discussion about 
      unsolved issues or conflicting arguments. Solving those issues and the apo-CRP 
      structure would enable us to finally define the CRP allostery.

      protein.
PG  - 6927-32
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0900595106 [doi]
AB  - The cAMP-mediated allosteric transition in the catabolite activator protein (CAP; 
      also known as the cAMP receptor protein, CRP) is a textbook example of modulation 
      of DNA-binding activity by small-molecule binding. Here we report the structure 
      of CAP in the absence of cAMP, which, together with structures of CAP in the 
      presence of cAMP, defines atomic details of the cAMP-mediated allosteric 
      transition. The structural changes, and their relationship to cAMP binding and 
      DNA binding, are remarkably clear and simple. Binding of cAMP results in a 
      coil-to-helix transition that extends the coiled-coil dimerization interface of 
      CAP by 3 turns of helix and concomitantly causes rotation, by approximately 60 
      degrees , and translation, by approximately 7 A, of the DNA-binding domains 
      (DBDs) of CAP, positioning the recognition helices in the DBDs in the correct 
      orientation to interact with DNA. The allosteric transition is stabilized further 
      by expulsion of an aromatic residue from the cAMP-binding pocket upon cAMP 
      binding. The results define the structural mechanisms that underlie allosteric 
      control of this prototypic transcriptional regulatory factor and provide an 
      illustrative example of how effector-mediated structural changes can control the 
      activity of regulatory proteins.

PG  - 219-24

AB  - Escherichia coli possesses two major systems for inorganic phosphate (P(i)) 
      uptake. The Pst system (pstSCAB) is inducible by low phosphate concentrations 
      whereas the low-affinity transporter (pitA) has been described as constitutively 
      expressed. PitA catalyses transport of metal [Mg(II), Ca(II)]-phosphate 
      complexes, and mutations in pitA confer Zn(II) resistance. Here we report that 
      pitA transcription is not constitutive; activity of a single-copy pitA-lacZ 
      transcriptional fusion (monolysogen) was maximal at high extracellular Zn(II) 
      (150 microM), in the absence of added P(i), and in a well-defined pitA mutant 
      strain. Intracellular zinc levels were unaffected by adding Zn(II) to the medium 
      for both the wild-type and mutant strains. However, in the wild-type strain, Mg 
      levels (per gram of dry biomass) fell by eightfold in cells grown with added 
      Zn(II) and by 20-fold when Zn(II) and P(i) were added to cultures. Mutation of 
      pitA reduced the effects of external Zn(II) and phosphate levels on Mg pools, 
      consistent with competition or inhibition by Zn(II) of PitA. The mechanism of 
      pitA regulation by extracellular Zn(II) and P(i) is unknown but appears not to 
      involve Fur or other well-characterized regulators.

AB  - The Escherichia coli K-12 malI-malX intergenic region contains two divergent 
      promoters, which have been investigated by both mutational and biochemical 
      analysis. The malX promoter drives transcription initiation from a location that 
      is 43 bp upstream from the malX translation start codon. Expression from the malX 
      promoter is dependent on binding of the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) to a 
      DNA site centred 41.5 bp upstream of the transcript start. The malI promoter 
      drives transcription initiation from a location 85 bp upstream from the malX 
      transcript start and it is active without the CRP. Expression from the malI 
      promoter can be stimulated by the CRP. Mutational analysis suggests that the malI 
      promoter has an unusual organization.

TI  - cAMP receptor protein from escherichia coli as a model of signal transduction in 
      proteins--a review.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1159/000178014 [doi]
AB  - In Escherichia coli, cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is known to regulate the 
      transcription of about 100 genes. The signal to activate CRP is the binding of 
      cyclic AMP. It has been suggested that binding of cAMP to CRP leads to a 
      long-distance signal transduction from the N-terminal cAMP-binding domain to the 
      C-terminal domain of the protein, which is responsible for interaction with 
      specific sequences of DNA. The signal transduction plays a crucial role in the 
      activation of the protein. The most sophisticated spectroscopic techniques, other 
      techniques frequently used in structural biochemistry, and site-directed 
      mutagenesis have been used to investigate the details of cAMP-mediated allosteric 
      control over CRP conformation and activity as a transcription factor. The aim of 
      this review is to summarize recent works and developments pertaining to 
      cAMP-dependent CRP signal transduction in E. coli.

TI  - The Crp-activated small noncoding regulatory RNA CyaR (RyeE) links nutritional 
      status to group behavior.
PG  - 461-76
LID - 10.1128/JB.01157-08 [doi]
AB  - Small noncoding regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) play a key role in regulating the 
      expression of many genes in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. Many of the 
      sRNAs identified in E. coli bind to mRNAs in an Hfq-dependent manner and 
      stimulate or inhibit translation of the mRNAs. Several sRNAs are regulated by 
      well-studied global regulators. Here, we report characterization of the CyaR 
      (RyeE) sRNA, which was previously identified in a global search for sRNAs in E. 
      coli. We demonstrated that CyaR is positively regulated by the global regulator 
      Crp under conditions in which cyclic AMP levels are high. We showed by using 
      microarray analysis and Northern blotting that several genes are negatively 
      regulated by CyaR, including ompX, encoding a major outer membrane protein; luxS, 
      encoding the autoinducer-2 synthase; nadE, encoding an essential NAD synthetase; 
      and yqaE, encoding a predicted membrane protein with an unknown function. Using 
      translational lacZ fusions to yqaE, ompX, nadE, and luxS, we demonstrated that 
      the negative regulation of these genes by CyaR occurs at the posttranscriptional 
      level and is direct. Different portions of a highly conserved 3' region of CyaR 
      are predicted to pair with sequences near the ribosome binding site of each of 
      these targets; mutations in this sequence affected regulation, and compensatory 
      mutations in the target mRNA restored regulation, confirming that there is direct 
      regulation by the sRNA. These results provide insight into the mechanisms by 
      which Crp negatively regulates genes such as luxS and ompX and provide a link 
      between catabolite repression, quorum sensing, and nitrogen assimilation in E. 
      coli.

TI  - The transcriptional factors MurR and catabolite activator protein regulate 
      N-acetylmuramic acid catabolism in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 6598-608
LID - 10.1128/JB.00642-08 [doi]
AB  - The MurNAc etherase MurQ of Escherichia coli is essential for the catabolism of 
      the bacterial cell wall sugar N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) obtained either from 
      the environment or from the endogenous cell wall (i.e., recycling). High-level 
      expression of murQ is required for growth on MurNAc as the sole source of carbon 
      and energy, whereas constitutive low-level expression of murQ is sufficient for 
      the recycling of peptidoglycan fragments continuously released from the cell wall 
      during growth of the bacteria. Here we characterize for the first time the 
      expression of murQ and its regulation by MurR, a member of the poorly 
      characterized RpiR/AlsR family of transcriptional regulators. Deleting murR 
      abolished the extensive lag phase observed for E. coli grown on MurNAc and 
      enhanced murQ transcription some 20-fold. MurR forms a stable multimer (most 
      likely a tetramer) and binds to two adjacent inverted repeats within an operator 
      region. In this way MurR represses transcription from the murQ promoter and also 
      interferes with its own transcription. MurNAc-6-phosphate, the substrate of MurQ, 
      was identified as a specific inducer that weakens binding of MurR to the 
      operator. Moreover, murQ transcription depends on the activation by cyclic AMP 
      (cAMP)-catabolite activator protein (CAP) bound to a class I site upstream of the 
      murQ promoter. murR and murQ are divergently orientated and expressed from 
      nonoverlapping face-to-face (convergent) promoters, yielding transcripts that are 
      complementary at their 5' ends. As a consequence of this unusual promoter 
      arrangement, cAMP-CAP also affects murR transcription, presumably by acting as a 
      roadblock for RNA polymerase.

      nutrients.
PG  - 613-24
LID - 10.1038/nrmicro1932 [doi]
AB  - Most bacteria can selectively use substrates from a mixture of different carbon 
      sources. The presence of preferred carbon sources prevents the expression, and 
      often also the activity, of catabolic systems that enable the use of secondary 
      substrates. This regulation, called carbon catabolite repression (CCR), can be 
      achieved by different regulatory mechanisms, including transcription activation 
      and repression and control of translation by an RNA-binding protein, in different 
      bacteria. Moreover, CCR regulates the expression of virulence factors in many 
      pathogenic bacteria. In this Review, we discuss the most recent findings on the 
      different mechanisms that have evolved to allow bacteria to use carbon sources in 
      a hierarchical manner.

TI  - Down-regulation of outer membrane proteins by noncoding RNAs: unraveling the 
      cAMP-CRP- and sigmaE-dependent CyaR-ompX regulatory case.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.06.058 [doi]
AB  - The sigma(E) (extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor in Escherichia coli) 
      signaling system of Gram-negative bacteria plays an essential role in the 
      maintenance of the extracytoplasmic compartment. Upon induction of this system, 
      approximately 100 genes are up-regulated. The majority of these genes encode 
      proteins that participate in the synthesis, assembly, and homeostasis of outer 
      membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharides. A second aspect of the sigma(E) 
      response is a regulatory loop that prevents expression of the major porins. 
      Misfolding or overproduction of most of these porins is sufficient to trigger the 
      envelope stress response. Recent work indicates that small Hfq-binding RNAs play 
      a major role in maintaining envelope homeostasis and, so far, two 
      sigma(E)-dependent small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs), MicA and RybB, have been shown 
      to facilitate rapid removal of multiple omp transcripts in response to elevated 
      activity of the alternative sigma factor. Here we report the identification of 
      the sRNA (CyaR, cyclic AMP-activated RNA) that promotes decay of the ompX mRNA. 
      The transcription of the cyaR gene is stringently controlled by cAMP-cAMP 
      receptor protein and, unexpectedly, cyaR expression is also up-regulated, 
      directly or indirectly, by sigma(E). In addition, this work identified MicA as a 
      factor that cooperates in the negative control of ompX expression. The 
      conservation of CyaR, MicA, RybB, and their targets suggests that the omp 
      mRNA-sRNA regulatory network is an integral part of the envelope stress response 
      in many enterobacteria.

TI  - CRP regulator modulates multidrug resistance of Escherichia coli by repressing 
      the mdtEF multidrug efflux genes.
PG  - 120-7
LID - 10.1038/ja.2008.120 [doi]
AB  - Multidrug efflux pumps contribute to the resistance of Escherichia coli against 
      many antibiotics and biocides. Here, we report that the CRP regulator modulates 
      multidrug resistance in E. coli through repression of the genes encoding the 
      MdtEF multidrug efflux pump. Screening of mutants for ability to increase 
      beta-lactam resistance in E. coli led to the identification of a mutation in crp, 
      which codes for the major global regulator of catabolite-sensitive operons. 
      Deletion of crp significantly increased the resistance of the E. coli strain to 
      oxacillin, azithromycin, erythromycin and crystal violet. The increase in drug 
      resistance caused by crp deletion was completely suppressed by deletion of the 
      multifunctional outer membrane channel gene tolC. TolC interacts with different 
      drug efflux pumps. Among the twenty drug efflux pumps in E. coli, quantitative 
      real-time PCR analysis showed that CRP repressed the expression of mdtEF. 
      Deletion of mdtEF completely suppressed CRP-modulated multidrug resistance. 
      Therefore, in addition to its role in catabolite control, CRP contributes to 
      multidrug resistance in E. coli. Our results indicate that the CRP regulator 
      modulates multidrug resistance in E. coli by repressing expression of the MdtEF 
      multidrug efflux pump.

TI  - The iscS gene deficiency affects the expression of pyrimidine metabolism genes.
PG  - 407-11
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.05.019 [doi]
AB  - Inactivation of iscS encoding cysteine desulfurase results in a slow growth 
      phenotype associated with the deficiency of iron-sulfur clusters, thiamine, NAD, 
      and tRNA thionucleosides in Escherichia coli. However, the other roles of iscSin 
      vivo are unknown. By using differential screening strategies, we identified 2 
      pyrimidine salvage enzymes, namely, uridine phosphorylase and cytidine deaminase, 
      which were down-regulated in the iscS mutant. Both enzymes are positively 
      regulated by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). We also identified a novel protein 
      complex, namely, YeiT-YeiA, whose expression level was decreased in the iscS 
      mutant. The recombinant YeiT-YeiA complex exhibited NADH-dependent 
      dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase activity, indicating its role in pyrimidine 
      metabolism. The presence of a CRP-binding consensus sequence on the 5'-upstream 
      of the yeiT-YeiA gene suggests its regulation by CRP. These results provide a 
      clue to the possible role of iscS in pyrimidine metabolism by gene regulation.

TI  - The mechanisms of carbon catabolite repression in bacteria.
PG  - 87-93
LID - 10.1016/j.mib.2008.02.007 [doi]
AB  - Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is the paradigm of cellular regulation. CCR 
      happens when bacteria are exposed to two or more carbon sources and one of them 
      is preferentially utilised (frequently glucose). CCR is often mediated by several 
      mechanisms, which can either affect the synthesis of catabolic enzymes via global 
      or specific regulators or inhibit the uptake of a carbon source and thus the 
      formation of the corresponding inducer. The major CCR mechanisms operative in 
      Enterobacteriaceae and Firmicutes are quite different, but in both types of 
      organisms components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase 
      system (PTS) and protein phosphorylation play a major role. PTS-independent CCR 
      mechanisms are operative in several other bacteria.

TI  - Correlation between growth rates, EIIACrr phosphorylation, and intracellular 
      cyclic AMP levels in Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 6891-900
AB  - In Escherichia coli K-12, components of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent 
      phosphotransferase systems (PTSs) represent a signal transduction system involved 
      in the global control of carbon catabolism through inducer exclusion mediated by 
      phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent protein kinase enzyme IIA(Crr) (EIIA(Crr)) (= 
      EIIA(Glc)) and catabolite repression mediated by the global regulator cyclic AMP 
      (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP). We measured in a systematic way the relation 
      between cellular growth rates and the key parameters of catabolite repression, 
      i.e., the phosphorylated EIIA(Crr) (EIIA(Crr) approximately P) level and the cAMP 
      level, using in vitro and in vivo assays. Different growth rates were obtained by 
      using either various carbon sources or by growing the cells with limited 
      concentrations of glucose, sucrose, and mannitol in continuous bioreactor 
      experiments. The ratio of EIIA(Crr) to EIIA(Crr) approximately P and the 
      intracellular cAMP concentrations, deduced from the activity of a 
      cAMP-CRP-dependent promoter, correlated well with specific growth rates between 
      0.3 h(-1) and 0.7 h(-1), corresponding to generation times of about 138 and 60 
      min, respectively. Below and above this range, these parameters were increasingly 
      uncoupled from the growth rate, which perhaps indicates an increasing role 
      executed by other global control systems, in particular the stringent-relaxed 
      response system.

TI  - Signal integration in the galactose network of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 465-76
AB  - The gal regulon of Escherichia coli contains genes involved in galactose 
      transport and metabolism. Transcription of the gal regulon genes is regulated in 
      different ways by two iso-regulatory proteins, Gal repressor (GalR) and Gal 
      isorepressor (GalS), which recognize the same binding sites in the absence of 
      d-galactose. DNA binding by both GalR and GalS is inhibited in the presence of 
      d-galactose. Many of the gal regulon genes are activated in the presence of the 
      adenosine cyclic-3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex. 
      We studied transcriptional regulation of the gal regulon promoters simultaneously 
      in a purified system and attempted to integrate the two small molecule signals, 
      d-galactose and cAMP, that modulate the isoregulators and CRP respectively, at 
      each promoter, using Boolean logic. Results show that similarly organized 
      promoters can have different input functions. We also found that in some cases 
      the activity of the promoter and the cognate gene can be described by different 
      logic gates. We combined the transcriptional network of the galactose regulon, 
      obtained from our experiments, with literature data to construct an integrated 
      map of the galactose network. Structural analysis of the network shows that at 
      the interface of the genetic and metabolic network, feedback loops are by far the 
      most common motif.

TI  - The multiple roles of CRP at the complex acs promoter depend on activation region 
      2 and IHF.
PG  - 425-40
AB  - acs encodes a high-affinity enzyme that permits survival during carbon 
      starvation. As befits a survival gene, its transcription is subject to complex 
      regulation. Previously, we reported that cAMP receptor protein (CRP) activates 
      acs transcription by binding tandem DNA sites located upstream of the major acsP2 
      promoter and that the nucleoid protein IHF (integration host factor) binds three 
      specific sites located just upstream. In vivo, the sequence that includes these 
      IHF sites exerts a positive effect on CRP-dependent transcription, while a 
      construct containing only the most proximal site exhibits reduced transcription 
      compared with the full-length promoter or with a construct lacking all three IHF 
      sites. Here, we defined the minimal system required for this IHF-dependent 
      inhibition, showing it requires the promoter-distal CRP site and an amino acid 
      residue located within activation region 2 (AR2), a surface determinant of CRP 
      that interacts with RNA polymerase (RNAP). Surprisingly, for a Class III 
      promoter, disruption of AR2 caused significant changes in the activity and 
      structure of both the full-length promoter and the construct with the single 
      proximal IHF site. We propose that AR2, together with IHF, mediates formation of 
      a multi-protein complex, in which RNAP is stabilized in an open complex that 
      remains poised on the promoter ready to respond rapidly to environmental changes.

TI  - Expression of Escherichia coli DcuS-R two-component regulatory system is 
      regulated by the secondary internal promoter which is activated by CRP-cAMP.
PG  - 234-40
AB  - The DcuS-R two-component system of Escherichia coli senses C4-dicarboxylates of 
      the medium and regulates expression of the genes related to utilization of them. 
      It is known that phospho-DcuR induces expression of genes such as the dcuB-fumB 
      operon, the frdABCD operon, and the dctA gene. We analyzed promoters of the 
      dcuS-R operon to elucidate the transcriptional regulation system. We found a 
      novel internal promoter within the dcuS gene that is regulated by the 
      transcriptional regulator, CRP-cAMP, in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

TI  - New targets for the cyclic AMP receptor protein in the Escherichia coli K-12 
      genome.
PG  - 89-94
AB  - Recent genomic studies with Escherichia coli K-12 have suggested scores of 
      previously unexplored targets for the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) global 
      transcription regulator. Eleven of these loci were cloned and CRP binding was 
      demonstrated at eight of these targets. It is shown that CRP can activate 
      transcription at five of these targets and the functional DNA sites for CRP are 
      identified. It is reported that CRP functions as a Class I activator at the aer 
      promoter and as a Class II activator at the gatY, sdaC, ychH and malX promoters.

TI  - Adaptation in bacterial flagellar and motility systems: from regulon members to 
      'foraging'-like behavior in E. coli.
PG  - 4441-52
AB  - Bacterial flagellar motility and chemotaxis help cells to reach the most 
      favorable environments and to successfully compete with other micro-organisms in 
      response to external stimuli. Escherichia coli is a motile gram-negative 
      bacterium, and the flagellar regulon in E. coli is controlled by a master 
      regulator FlhDC as well as a second regulator, flagellum-specific sigma factor, 
      sigma(F). To define the physiological role of these two regulators, we carried 
      out transcription profiling experiments to identify, on a genome-wide basis, 
      genes under the control of these two regulators. In addition, the synchronized 
      pattern of increasing CRP activity causing increasing FlhDC expression with 
      decreasing carbon source quality, together with the apparent coupling of motility 
      activity with the activation of motility and chemotaxis genes in poor quality 
      carbon sources, highlights the importance of CRP activation in allowing E. coli 
      to devote progressively more of its limited reserves to search out better 
      conditions. In adaptation to a variety of carbon sources, the motile bacteria 
      carry out tactical responses by increasing flagellar operation but restricting 
      costly flagellar synthesis, indicating its capability of strategically using the 
      precious energy in nutrient-poor environments for maximizing survival.

TI  - Identification of regulatory network topological units coordinating the 
      genome-wide transcriptional response to glucose in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucose is the preferred carbon and energy source for Escherichia 
      coli. A complex regulatory network coordinates gene expression, transport and 
      enzyme activities in response to the presence of this sugar. To determine the 
      extent of the cellular response to glucose, we applied an approach combining 
      global transcriptome and regulatory network analyses. RESULTS: Transcriptome data 
      from isogenic wild type and crp- strains grown in Luria-Bertani medium (LB) or LB 
      + 4 g/L glucose (LB+G) were analyzed to identify differentially transcribed 
      genes. We detected 180 and 200 genes displaying increased and reduced relative 
      transcript levels in the presence of glucose, respectively. The observed 
      expression pattern in LB was consistent with a gluconeogenic metabolic state 
      including active transport and interconversion of small molecules and 
      macromolecules, induction of protease-encoding genes and a partial heat shock 
      response. In LB+G, catabolic repression was detected for transport and metabolic 
      interconversion activities. We also detected an increased capacity for de novo 
      synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids and proteins. Cluster analysis of a subset 
      of genes revealed that CRP mediates catabolite repression for most of the genes 
      displaying reduced transcript levels in LB+G, whereas Fis participates in the 
      upregulation of genes under this condition. An analysis of the regulatory 
      network, in terms of topological functional units, revealed 8 interconnected 
      modules which again exposed the importance of Fis and CRP as directly responsible 
      for the coordinated response of the cell. This effect was also seen with other 
      not extensively connected transcription factors such as FruR and PdhR, which 
      showed a consistent response considering media composition. CONCLUSION: This work 
      allowed the identification of eight interconnected regulatory network modules 
      that includes CRP, Fis and other transcriptional factors that respond directly or 
      indirectly to the presence of glucose. In most cases, each of these modules 
      includes genes encoding physiologically related functions, thus indicating a 
      connection between regulatory network topology and related cellular functions 
      involved in nutrient sensing and metabolism.

TI  - YcfR (BhsA) influences Escherichia coli biofilm formation through stress response 
      and surface hydrophobicity.
PG  - 3051-62
AB  - DNA microarrays revealed that expression of ycfR, which encodes a putative outer 
      membrane protein, is significantly induced in Escherichia coli biofilms and is 
      also induced by several stress conditions. We show that deletion of ycfR 
      increased biofilm formation fivefold in the presence of glucose; the glucose 
      effect was corroborated by showing binding of the cyclic AMP receptor protein to 
      the ycfR promoter. It appears that YcfR is a multiple stress resistance protein, 
      since deleting ycfR also rendered the cell more sensitive to acid, heat 
      treatment, hydrogen peroxide, and cadmium. Increased biofilm formation through 
      YcfR due to stress appears to be the result of decreasing indole synthesis, since 
      a mutation in the tnaA gene encoding tryptophanase prevented enhanced biofilm 
      formation upon stress and adding indole prevented enhanced biofilm formation upon 
      stress. Deleting ycfR also affected outer membrane proteins and converted the 
      cell from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, as well as increased cell aggregation 
      fourfold. YcfR seems to be involved in the regulation of E. coli K-12 biofilm 
      formation by decreasing cell aggregation and cell surface adhesion, by 
      influencing the concentration of signal molecules, and by interfering with stress 
      responses. Based on our findings, we propose that this locus be named bhsA, for 
      influencing biofilm through hydrophobicity and stress response.

TI  - Interplay between CRP-cAMP and PII-Ntr systems forms novel regulatory network 
      between carbon metabolism and nitrogen assimilation in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1432-40
AB  - In Escherichia coli, utilization of carbon sources is regulated by the 
      phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS), which modulates 
      the intracellular levels of cAMP. The cAMP receptor protein (CRP) controls the 
      transcription of many catabolic genes. The availability of nitrogen is sensed by 
      the PII protein at the level of intracellular glutamine. Glutamine is transported 
      mainly by GlnHPQ, and synthesized by glutamine synthetase (GS) encoded by glnA. 
      Previous studies suggest that CRP affects nitrogen assimilation. Here we showed 
      that at least two mechanisms are involved. First, CRP activates glnHp1 via 
      synergistic binding with sigma 70 RNA polymerase (Esigma(70)) and represses 
      glnHp2. As a consequence, in the presence of glutamine, the overall enhancement 
      of glnHPQ expression alters GlnB signalling and de-activates glnAp2. Second, in 
      vitro studies show that CRP can be recruited by sigma 54 holoenzyme (Esigma(54)) 
      to a site centred at -51.5 upstream of glnAp2. CRP-induced DNA-bending prevents 
      the nitrogen regulation protein C (NtrC) activator from approaching the 
      activator-accessible face of the promoter-bound Esigma(54) closed complex, and 
      inhibits glnAp2. Therefore, as the major transcriptional effector of the 'glucose 
      effect', CRP affects both the signal transduction pathway and the overall 
      geometry of the transcriptional machinery of components of the nitrogen regulon.

TI  - Integration of regulatory signals through involvement of multiple global 
      regulators: control of the Escherichia coli gltBDF operon by Lrp, IHF, Crp, and 
      ArgR.
PG  - 2
AB  - BACKGROUND: The glutamate synthase operon (gltBDF) contributes to one of the two 
      main pathways of ammonia assimilation in Escherichia coli. Of the seven 
      most-global regulators, together affecting expression of about half of all E. 
      coli genes, two were previously shown to exert direct, positive control on gltBDF 
      transcription: Lrp and IHF. The involvement of Lrp is unusual in two respects: 
      first, it is insensitive to the usual coregulator leucine, and second, Lrp binds 
      more than 150 bp upstream of the transcription starting point. There was indirect 
      evidence for involvement of a third global regulator, Crp. Given the 
      physiological importance of gltBDF, and the potential opportunity to learn about 
      integration of global regulatory signals, a combination of in vivo and in vitro 
      approaches was used to investigate the involvement of additional regulatory 
      proteins, and to determine their relative binding positions and potential 
      interactions with one another and with RNA polymerase (RNAP). RESULTS: Crp and a 
      more local regulator, ArgR, directly control gltBDF transcription, both acting 
      negatively. Crp-cAMP binds a sequence centered at -65.5 relative to the 
      transcript start. Mutation of conserved nucleotides in the Crp binding site 
      abolishes the Crp-dependent repression. ArgR also binds to the gltBDF promoter 
      region, upstream of the Lrp binding sites, and decreases transcription. RNAP only 
      yields a defined DNAse I footprint under two tested conditions: in the presence 
      of both Lrp and IHF, or in the presence of Crp-cAMP. The DNAse I footprint of 
      RNAP in the presence of Lrp and IHF is altered by ArgR. CONCLUSION: The 
      involvement of nearly half of E. coli's most-global regulatory proteins in the 
      control of gltBDF transcription is striking, but seems consistent with the 
      central metabolic role of this operon. Determining the mechanisms of activation 
      and repression for gltBDF was beyond the scope of this study. However the results 
      are consistent with a model in which IHF bends the DNA to allow stabilizing 
      contacts between Lrp and RNAP, ArgR interferes with such contacts, and Crp 
      introduces an interfering bend in the DNA and/or stabilizes RNAP in a poised but 
      inactive state.

TI  - Identification and characterization of a second, inducible promoter of relA in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 299-310
AB  - The alarmone ppGpp is an important signal molecule for the stringent response. 
      Escherichia coli relA encodes a ppGpp synthetase, and although the regulation of 
      RelA protein activity has been studied extensively, the regulation of relA 
      transcription remains unclear. Here, we describe a novel relA promoter, relAP2. 
      According to quantitative measurement of mRNA by primer extension analysis, the 
      previously reported promoter relAP1 is constitutively active throughout growth, 
      while relAP2 is induced temporarily at the transition state between the 
      exponential growth and stationary phases. A chromosomal transcriptional lacZ 
      fusion (relAP2-lacZ) showed that relAP2 is positively regulated by H-NS and CRP. 
      Furthermore, the reduced activity of relAP2-lacZ in an hns mutant could be 
      rescued by an rpoS mutation, which is sufficient to derepress the relAP2-lacZ 
      activity. These data suggest that transient expression from the relAP2 promoter 
      is controlled by several global regulators. This may account for the complex 
      regulation of relA expression in Escherichia coli.

TI  - How phosphotransferase system-related protein phosphorylation regulates 
      carbohydrate metabolism in bacteria.
PG  - 939-1031
AB  - The phosphoenolpyruvate(PEP):carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) is 
      found only in bacteria, where it catalyzes the transport and phosphorylation of 
      numerous monosaccharides, disaccharides, amino sugars, polyols, and other sugar 
      derivatives. To carry out its catalytic function in sugar transport and 
      phosphorylation, the PTS uses PEP as an energy source and phosphoryl donor. The 
      phosphoryl group of PEP is usually transferred via four distinct proteins 
      (domains) to the transported sugar bound to the respective membrane component(s) 
      (EIIC and EIID) of the PTS. The organization of the PTS as a four-step phosphoryl 
      transfer system, in which all P derivatives exhibit similar energy 
      (phosphorylation occurs at histidyl or cysteyl residues), is surprising, as a 
      single protein (or domain) coupling energy transfer and sugar phosphorylation 
      would be sufficient for PTS function. A possible explanation for the complexity 
      of the PTS was provided by the discovery that the PTS also carries out numerous 
      regulatory functions. Depending on their phosphorylation state, the four proteins 
      (domains) forming the PTS phosphorylation cascade (EI, HPr, EIIA, and EIIB) can 
      phosphorylate or interact with numerous non-PTS proteins and thereby regulate 
      their activity. In addition, in certain bacteria, one of the PTS components (HPr) 
      is phosphorylated by ATP at a seryl residue, which increases the complexity of 
      PTS-mediated regulation. In this review, we try to summarize the known protein 
      phosphorylation-related regulatory functions of the PTS. As we shall see, the PTS 
      regulation network not only controls carbohydrate uptake and metabolism but also 
      interferes with the utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus and the virulence of 
      certain pathogens.

TI  - Accuracy of single-photon emission computed tomography in differentiating 
      frontotemporal dementia from Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 350-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the 
      commonest causes of presenile dementia. In the absence of a biological marker, 
      diagnosis is reliant on clinical evaluation. Confirmation is often sought from 
      neuroimaging, including single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Most 
      previous SPECT studies lack pathological validation. AIM: To examine the accuracy 
      of SPECT in differentiating FTD from AD in patients with subsequent pathological 
      confirmation. METHODS: Technetium-99-labelled hexamethyl propylene amine oxime 
      SPECT images obtained at initial evaluation in 25 pathologically confirmed cases 
      of FTD were examined. These images were visually rated by an experienced blinded 
      nuclear medicine consultant and compared with those of 31 patients with AD, also 
      with pathological validation. RESULTS: A reduction in frontal cerebral blood flow 
      (CBF) was more common in FTD and was of diagnostic value (sensitivity 0.8, 
      specificity 0.65 and likelihood ratio (LR) 2.25; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.77). A pattern 
      of bilateral frontal CBF reduction without the presence of associated bilateral 
      parietal CBF change is diagnostically more accurate (sensitivity 0.80, 
      specificity 0.81 and +LR 4.13, 95% CI 1.96 to 8.71). Diagnostic categorisation 
      (FTD or AD) on the basis of SPECT alone was less accurate than clinical diagnosis 
      (based on neurology and detailed neuropsychological evaluation). One patient with 
      FTD was initially clinically misdiagnosed as AD, owing to the lack of 
      availability of full neuropsychological assessment. However, SPECT correctly 
      diagnosed this patient, providing a diagnostic gain of 4%. CONCLUSION: 
      Technetium-99-labelled hexamethyl propylene amine oxime SPECT CBF patterns 
      provide valuable information in the diagnosis of FTD and AD. These data can be 
      better used as an adjunct to clinical diagnosis if pathology is to be correctly 
      predicted in life.

TI  - Non-canonical CRP sites control competence regulons in Escherichia coli and many 
      other gamma-proteobacteria.
PG  - 6001-14
AB  - Escherichia coli's cAMP receptor protein (CRP), the archetypal bacterial 
      transcription factor, regulates over a hundred promoters by binding 22 bp 
      symmetrical sites with the consensus core half-site TGTGA. However, Haemophilus 
      influenzae has two types of CRP sites, one like E.coli's and one with the core 
      sequence TGCGA that regulates genes required for DNA uptake (natural competence). 
      Only the latter 'CRP-S' sites require both CRP and the coregulator Sxy for 
      activation. To our knowledge, the TGTGA and TGCGA motifs are the first example of 
      one transcription factor having two distinct binding-site motifs. Here we show 
      that CRP-S promoters are widespread in the gamma-proteobacteria and demonstrate 
      their Sxy-dependence in E.coli. Orthologs of most H.influenzae CRP-S-regulated 
      genes are ubiquitous in the five best-studied gamma-proteobacteria families, 
      Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Vibrionaceae and 
      Xanthomonadaceae. Phylogenetic footprinting identified CRP-S sites in the 
      promoter regions of the Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae and Vibrionaceae 
      orthologs, and canonical CRP sites in orthologs of genes known to be 
      Sxy-independent in H.influenzae. Bandshift experiments confirmed that E.coli 
      CRP-S sequences are low affinity binding sites for CRP, and mRNA analysis showed 
      that they require CRP, cAMP (CRP's allosteric effector) and Sxy for gene 
      induction. This work suggests not only that the gamma-proteobacteria share a

TI  - Effect of salt bridge on transcription activation of CRP-dependent lactose operon 
      in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 217-23
AB  - Expression of catabolite-sensitive operons in Escherichia coli is cAMP-dependent 
      and mediated through the CRP:cAMP complex binding to specific sequences in DNA. 
      Five specific ionic or polar interactions occur in cAMP binding pocket of CRP. 
      E72 interacts with the cAMP 2' OH, R82 and S83 interact with the negatively 
      charged phosphate moiety, and T127 and S128 interact with the adenine ring. There 
      is evidence to suggest that E72 and R82 may mediate an essential CRP molecular 
      switch mechanism. Therefore, stimulation of CRP transcription activation was 
      examined by perturbing these residues. Further, CRP:cAMP complex was treated with 
      a specific DNA sequence containing the lac CRP binding site along with RNA 
      polymerase to mimic in vivo conditions. Biochemical and biophysical results 
      revealed that regulation of transcription activation depends on alignment of CRP 
      tertiary structure through inter-domain communication and it was concluded that 
      positions 72 and 82 are essential in the activation of CRP by cAMP.

TI  - Cyclic AMP-dependent osmoregulation of crp gene expression in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5935-44
AB  - We have found that the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP)-cAMP regulatory 
      complex in Escherichia coli is subject to osmoregulation at the level of crp gene 
      expression. This osmoregulation was lost in a cya mutant strain but could be 
      restored by external addition of cAMP, suggesting that the intracellular level of 
      cAMP is a key factor in the osmoregulation of CRP. The ability of the cell to 
      maintain optimal CRP activity was essential for the growth and survival of the 
      bacteria under low-osmolarity conditions as shown by studies with different crp 
      mutant alleles. A suppressor mutant with a novel amino acid substitution (L124R) 
      in CRP showed restored growth at low osmolarity. CRP(L124R) was not activated by 
      cAMP and was shown to be dominant negative over the wild type. Our findings 
      suggest that the fine-tuning of the CRP activity may be critical for bacterial 
      viability and adaptability to changing osmotic conditions.

TI  - N-acetyl-d-glucosamine induces the expression of multidrug exporter genes, mdtEF, 
      via catabolite activation in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5851-8
AB  - The expression of MdtEF, a multidrug exporter in Escherichia coli, is positively 
      controlled through multiple signaling pathways, but little is known about signals 
      that induce MdtEF expression. In this study, we investigated compounds that 
      induce the expression of the mdtEF genes and found that out of 20 drug exporter 
      genes in E. coli, the expression of mdtEF is greatly induced by 
      N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc). The induction of mdtEF by GlcNAc is not mediated 
      by the evgSA, ydeO, gadX, and rpoS signaling pathways that have been known to 
      regulate mdtEF expression. On the other hand, deletion of the nagE gene, encoding 
      the phosphotransferase (PTS) system for GlcNAc, prevented induction by GlcNAc. 
      The induction of mdtEF by GlcNAc was also greatly inhibited by the addition of 
      cyclic AMP (cAMP) and completely abolished upon deletion of the cAMP receptor 
      protein gene (crp). Other PTS sugars, glucose and d-glucosamine, also induced 
      mdtEF gene expression. These results suggest that mdtEF expression is stimulated 
      through catabolite control.

TI  - Mutational analysis of the Escherichia coli melR gene suggests a two-state 
      concerted model to explain transcriptional activation and repression in the 
      melibiose operon.
PG  - 3199-207
AB  - Transcription of the Escherichia coli melAB operon is regulated by the MelR 
      protein, an AraC family member whose activity is modulated by the binding of 
      melibiose. In the absence of melibiose, MelR is unable to activate the melAB 
      promoter but autoregulates its own expression by repressing the melR promoter. 
      Melibiose triggers MelR-dependent activation of the melAB promoter and relieves 
      MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter. Twenty-nine single amino acid 
      substitutions in MelR that result in partial melibiose-independent activation of 
      the melAB promoter have been identified. Combinations of different substitutions 
      result in almost complete melibiose-independent activation of the melAB promoter. 
      MelR carrying each of the single substitutions is less able to repress the melR 
      promoter, while MelR carrying some combinations of substitutions is completely 
      unable to repress the melR promoter. These results argue that different 
      conformational states of MelR are responsible for activation of the melAB 
      promoter and repression of the melR promoter. Supporting evidence for this is 
      provided by the isolation of substitutions in MelR that block melibiose-dependent 
      activation of the melAB promoter while not changing melibiose-independent 
      repression of the melR promoter. Additional experiments with a bacterial 
      two-hybrid system suggest that interactions between MelR subunits differ 
      according to the two conformational states.

TI  - In vitro reconstitution of catabolite repression in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 6448-54
AB  - A widely accepted model for catabolite repression posits that phospho-IIAGlc of 
      the bacterial phosphotransferase system activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity. 
      For many years, attempts to observe such regulatory properties of AC in vitro 
      have been unsuccessful. To further study the regulation, AC was produced fused to 
      the transmembrane segments of the serine chemoreceptor Tsr. Cells harboring 
      Tsr-AC and normal AC, expressed from the cya promoter on a low copy number 
      vector, exhibit similar behavior with respect to elevation of cAMP levels 
      resulting from deletion of crp, expressing the catabolite regulatory protein. 
      Membrane-bound Tsr-AC exhibits activity comparable with the native form of AC. 
      Tsr-AC binds IIAGlc specifically, regardless of its phosphorylation state, but 
      not the two general phosphotransferase system proteins, enzyme I and HPr; IIAGlc 
      binding is localized to the C-terminal region of AC. Binding to membranes of 
      either dephospho- or phospho-IIAGlc has no effect on AC activity. However, in the 
      presence of an Escherichia coli extract, P-IIAGlc, but not IIAGlc, stimulates AC 
      activity. Based on these findings of a direct interaction of IIAGlc with AC, but 
      activity regulation only in the presence of E. coli extract, a revised model for 
      AC activity regulation is proposed.

TI  - luxS-dependent gene regulation in Escherichia coli K-12 revealed by genomic 
      expression profiling.
PG  - 8350-60
AB  - The bacterial quorum-sensing autoinducer 2 (AI-2) has received intense interest 
      because the gene for its synthase, luxS, is common among a large number of 
      bacterial species. We have identified luxS-controlled genes in Escherichia coli 
      under two different growth conditions using DNA microarrays. Twenty-three genes 
      were affected by luxS deletion in the presence of glucose, and 63 genes were 
      influenced by luxS deletion in the absence of glucose. Minimal overlap among 
      these gene sets suggests the role of luxS is condition dependent. Under the 
      latter condition, the metE gene, the lsrACDBFG operon, and the flanking genes of 
      the lsr operon (lsrR, lsrK, tam, and yneE) were among the most significantly 
      induced genes by luxS. The E. coli lsr operon includes an additional gene, tam, 
      encoding an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase. Also, lsrR and 
      lsrK belong to the same operon, lsrRK, which is positively regulated by the 
      cyclic AMP receptor protein and negatively regulated by LsrR. lsrK is 
      additionally transcribed by a promoter between lsrR and lsrK. Deletion of luxS 
      was also shown to affect genes involved in methionine biosynthesis, methyl 
      transfer reactions, iron uptake, and utilization of carbon. It was surprising, 
      however, that so few genes were affected by luxS deletion in this E. coli K-12 
      strain under these conditions. Most of the highly induced genes are related to 
      AI-2 production and transport. These data are consistent with the function of 
      LuxS as an important metabolic enzyme but appear not to support the role of AI-2 
      as a true signal molecule for E. coli W3110 under the investigated conditions.

TI  - Studies of the distribution of Escherichia coli cAMP-receptor protein and RNA 
      polymerase along the E. coli chromosome.
PG  - 17693-8
AB  - Chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-density microarrays have been used to 
      monitor the distribution of the global transcription regulator Escherichia coli 
      cAMP-receptor protein (CRP) and RNA polymerase along the E. coli chromosome. Our 
      results identify targets occupied by CRP and genes transcribed by RNA polymerase 
      in vivo. Many of the loci of CRP binding are at known CRP regulated promoters. 
      However, our results show that CRP also interacts with thousands of weaker sites 
      across the whole chromosome and that this "background" binding can be used as a 
      probe for organization within the E. coli folded chromosome. In rapidly growing 
      cells, we show that the major sites of RNA polymerase binding are approximately 
      90 transcription units that include genes needed for protein synthesis. Upon the 
      addition of rifampicin, RNA polymerase is distributed among >500 functional 
      promoters. We show that the chromatin immunoprecipitation and 
      high-density-microarrays methodology can be used to study the redistribution of 
      RNA polymerase induced by environmental stress, revealing previously 
      uncharacterized aspects of RNA polymerase behavior and providing an alternative 
      to the "transcriptomics" approach for studying global transcription patterns.

TI  - Cyclic AMP receptor protein and RhaR synergistically activate transcription from 
      the L-rhamnose-responsive rhaSR promoter in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 6708-18
AB  - The Escherichia coli rhaSR operon encodes two AraC family transcription activator 
      proteins, RhaS and RhaR, which regulate expression of the l-rhamnose catabolic 
      regulon in response to l-rhamnose availability. RhaR positively regulates rhaSR 
      in response to l-rhamnose, and RhaR activation can be enhanced by the cyclic AMP 
      (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) protein. CRP is a well-studied global transcription 
      regulator that binds to DNA as a dimer and activates transcription in the 
      presence of cAMP. We investigated the mechanism of CRP activation at rhaSR both 
      alone and in combination with RhaR in vivo and in vitro. Base pair substitutions 
      at potential CRP binding sites in the rhaSR-rhaBAD intergenic region demonstrate 
      that CRP site 3, centered at position -111.5 relative to the rhaSR transcription 
      start site, is required for the majority of the CRP-dependent activation of 
      rhaSR. DNase I footprinting confirms that CRP binds to site 3; CRP binding to the 
      other potential CRP sites at rhaSR was not detected. We show that, at least in 
      vitro, CRP is capable of both RhaR-dependent and RhaR-independent activation of 
      rhaSR from a total of three transcription start sites. In vitro transcription 
      assays indicate that the carboxy-terminal domain of the alpha subunit (alpha-CTD) 
      of RNA polymerase is at least partially dispensable for RhaR-dependent activation 
      but that the alpha-CTD is required for CRP activation of rhaSR. Although CRP 
      requires the presence of RhaR for efficient in vivo activation of rhaSR, DNase I 
      footprinting assays indicated that cooperative binding between RhaR and CRP does 
      not make a significant contribution to the mechanism of CRP activation at rhaSR. 
      It therefore appears that CRP activates transcription from rhaSR as it would at 
      simple class I promoters, albeit from a relatively distant position.

TI  - Catabolite repression of the propionate catabolic genes in Escherichia coli and 
      Salmonella enterica: evidence for involvement of the cyclic AMP receptor protein.
PG  - 2793-800
AB  - Previous studies with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 demonstrated 
      that transcriptional activation of the prpBCDE operon requires the function of 
      transcription factor PrpR, sigma-54, and IHF. In this study, we found that 
      transcription from the prpBCDE and prpR promoters was down-regulated by the 
      addition of glucose or glycerol, indicating that these genes may be regulated by 
      the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex. Targeted mutagenesis 
      of a putative CRP-binding site in the promoter region between prpR and prpBCDE 
      suggested that these genes are under the control of CRP. Furthermore, cells with 
      defects in cya or crp exhibited reduced transcriptional activation of prpR and 
      prpBCDE in Escherichia coli. These results demonstrate that propionate metabolism 
      is subject to catabolite repression by the global transcriptional regulator CRP 
      and that this regulation is effected through control of both the regulator gene 
      prpR and the prpBCDE operon itself. The unique properties of the regulation of 
      these two divergent promoters may have important implications for mechanisms of 
      CRP-dependent catabolite repression acting in conjunction with a member of the 
      sigma-54 family of transcriptional activators.

TI  - A novel CRP-dependent regulon controls expression of competence genes in 
      Haemophilus influenzae.
PG  - 735-47
AB  - Natural competence for DNA uptake is common among bacteria but its evolutionary 
      function is controversial. Resolving the dispute requires a detailed 
      understanding of both how cells decide to take up DNA and how the DNA is 
      processed during and after uptake. We have used whole-genome microarrays to 
      follow changes in gene expression during competence development in wild-type 
      Haemophilus influenzae cells, and to characterize dependence of 
      competence-induced transcription on known regulatory factors. This analysis 
      confirmed the existence of a postulated competence regulon, characterized by a 
      promoter-associated 22 bp competence regulatory element (CRE) closely related to 
      the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) binding consensus. This CRE regulon contains 25 
      genes in 13 transcription units, only about half of which have been previously 
      associated with competence. The new CRE genes encode a periplasmic ATP-dependent 
      DNA ligase, homologs of SSB, RadC and the Bacillus subtilis DNA uptake protein 
      ComEA, and eight genes of unknown function. Competence-induced transcription of 
      genes in the CRE regulon is strongly dependent on cAMP, consistent with the known 
      role of catabolite regulation in competence. Electrophoretic mobility-shift 
      assays confirmed that CRE sequences are a new class of CRP-binding site. The 
      essential competence gene sxy is induced early in competence development and is 
      required for competence-induced transcription of CRE-regulon genes but not other 
      CRP-regulated genes, suggesting that Sxy may act as an accessory factor directing 
      CRP to CRE sites. Natural selection has united these 25 genes under a common 
      regulatory mechanism. Elucidating this mechanism, and the functions of the genes, 
      will provide a valuable window into the evolutionary function of natural 
      competence.

TI  - Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP receptor protein influence both synthesis and uptake 
      of extracellular autoinducer 2 in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 2066-76
AB  - Bacterial autoinducer 2 (AI-2) is proposed to be an interspecies mediator of 
      cell-cell communication that enables cells to operate at the multicellular level. 
      Many environmental stimuli have been shown to affect the extracellular AI-2 
      levels, carbon sources being among the most important. In this report, we show 
      that both AI-2 synthesis and uptake in Escherichia coli are subject to catabolite 
      repression through the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-CRP complex, which directly stimulates 
      transcription of the lsr (for "luxS regulated") operon and indirectly represses 
      luxS expression. Specifically, cAMP-CRP is shown to bind to a CRP binding site 
      located in the upstream region of the lsr promoter and works with the LsrR 
      repressor to regulate AI-2 uptake. The functions of the lsr operon and its 
      regulators, LsrR and LsrK, previously reported in Salmonella enterica serovar 
      Typhimurium, are confirmed here for E. coli. The elucidation of cAMP-CRP 
      involvement in E. coli autoinduction impacts many areas, including the growth of 
      E. coli in fermentation processes.

TI  - Function and expression of an N-acetylneuraminic acid-inducible outer membrane 
      channel in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1959-65
AB  - The Escherichia coli yjhA (renamed nanC) gene encodes a protein of the KdgM 
      family of outer membrane-specific channels. It is transcribed divergently from 
      fimB, a gene involved in the site-specific inversion of the region controlling 
      transcription of the fimbrial structural genes but is separated from it by one of 
      the largest intergenic regions in E. coli. We show that nanC expression is 
      induced by N-acetylneuraminic acid and modulated by N-acetylglucosamine. This 
      regulation occurs via the NanR and NagC regulators, which also control fimB 
      expression. nanC expression is also activated by the regulators cyclic 
      AMP-catabolite activator protein, OmpR, and CpxR. When the NanC protein was 
      reconstituted into liposomes, it formed channels with a conductance of 450 pS at 
      positive potential and 300 to 400 pS at negative potential in 800 mM KCl. The 
      channels had a weak anionic selectivity. In an ompR background, where the general 
      porins OmpF and OmpC are absent, NanC is required for growth of E. coli on 
      N-acetylneuraminic acid as the sole carbon source. All these results suggest that 
      NanC is an N-acetylneuraminic acid outer membrane channel protein.

TI  - Functional interactions between the carbon and iron utilization regulators, Crp 
      and Fur, in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 980-90
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) controls expression of the 
      iron regulon in response to iron availability while the cyclic AMP receptor 
      protein (Crp) regulates expression of the carbon regulon in response to carbon 
      availability. We here identify genes subject to significant changes in expression 
      level in response to the loss of both Fur and Crp. Many iron transport genes and 
      several carbon metabolic genes are subject to dual control, being repressed by 
      the loss of Crp and activated by the loss of Fur. However, the sodB gene, 
      encoding superoxide dismutase, and the aceBAK operon, encoding the glyoxalate 
      shunt enzymes, show the opposite responses, being activated by the loss of Crp 
      and repressed by the loss of Fur. Several other genes including the sdhA-D, 
      sucA-D, and fumA genes, encoding key constituents of the Krebs cycle, proved to 
      be repressed by the loss of both transcription factors. Finally, the loss of both 
      Crp and Fur activated a heterogeneous group of genes under sigmaS control 
      encoding, for example, the cyclopropane fatty acid synthase, Cfa, the glycogen 
      synthesis protein, GlgS, the 30S ribosomal protein, S22, and the mechanosensitive 
      channel protein, YggB. Many genes appeared to be regulated by the two 
      transcription factors in an apparently additive fashion, but apparent positive or 
      negative cooperativity characterized several putative Crp/Fur interactions. 
      Relevant published data were evaluated, putative Crp and Fur binding sites were 
      identified, and representative results were confirmed by real-time PCR. Molecular 
      explanations for some, but not all, of these effects are provided.

TI  - Identification of the CRP regulon using in vitro and in vivo transcriptional 
      profiling.
PG  - 5874-93
AB  - The Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is a global regulator that 
      controls transcription initiation from more than 100 promoters by binding to a 
      specific DNA sequence within cognate promoters. Many genes in the CRP regulon 
      have been predicted simply based on the presence of DNA-binding sites within gene 
      promoters. In this study, we have exploited a newly developed technique, run-off 
      transcription/microarray analysis (ROMA) to define CRP-regulated promoters. Using 
      ROMA, we identified 176 operons that were activated by CRP in vitro and 16 
      operons that were repressed. Using positive control mutants in different regions 
      of CRP, we were able to classify the different promoters into class I or class 
      II/III. A total of 104 operons were predicted to contain Class II CRP-binding 
      sites. Sequence analysis of the operons that were repressed by CRP revealed 
      different mechanisms for CRP inhibition. In contrast, the in vivo transcriptional 
      profiles failed to identify most CRP-dependent regulation because of the 
      complexity of the regulatory network. Analysis of these operons supports the 
      hypothesis that CRP is not only a regulator of genes required for catabolism of 
      sugars other than glucose, but also regulates the expression of a large number of 
      other genes in E.coli. ROMA has revealed 152 hitherto unknown CRP regulons.

TI  - GntP is the Escherichia coli Fructuronic acid transporter and belongs to the UxuR 
      regulon.
PG  - 7690-6
AB  - Escherichia coli has four gluconate transporters, GntP, GntU, GntT, and IdnT, 
      which are members of the major facilitator superfamily. The physiological 
      function of GntP was previously unknown and is the subject of this study. GntP is 
      not induced by gluconate, and despite being located adjacent to genes involved in 
      glucuronate catabolism, gntP does not encode a glucuronate transporter. Here we 
      identify gntP as the gene which encodes the fructuronate transporter. We show 
      that gntP is induced by fructuronate and is a new member of the UxuR regulon: 
      gntP is derepressed in an uxuR strain, UxuR binds in vitro specifically to an 
      operator site that overlaps the gntP promoter, and UxuR binding is eliminated by 
      fructuronate. Transcription of gntP requires activation by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP 
      receptor protein. A gntP mutant cannot grow on fructuronate but grows normally on 
      glucuronate and gluconate. Thus, the UxuR regulon is a module of sugar acid 
      catabolism whose physiological role is for growth on fructuronate. Glucuronate, 
      because it proceeds through a fructuronate intermediate, must induce the UxuR 
      regulon and must also induce the ExuR regulon, which encodes the glucuronate 
      transporter, ExuT, and the first step in its catabolism, UxaC. Thus, hexuronate 
      catabolism in E. coli requires both the ExuR and UxuR regulons, while 
      fructuronate catabolism requires only the UxuR regulon.

TI  - lacP1 promoter with an extended -10 motif. Pleiotropic effects of cyclic AMP 
      protein at different steps of transcription initiation.
PG  - 54552-7
AB  - The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), which activates transcription from the 
      wild-type lacP1 promoter and most of its mutants, represses productive RNA 
      synthesis from a lacP1 promoter variant that contains an extended -10 element, 
      although CRP enhances RNA polymerase binding as well as open complex formation in 
      both promoters. Moreover, abortive RNA synthesis, which is already higher in the 
      extended -10 variant compared with the parent promoter, was further enhanced by 
      CRP. These results, together with the observed decrease in productive RNA 
      synthesis, indicate that CRP, while facilitating the earlier steps of initiation, 
      inhibits transcription from the extended -10 lacP1 by hindering promoter 
      clearance. We propose that CRP decreases energetic barriers to RNA polymerase 
      binding, isomerization, and abortive RNA synthesis but stabilizes the abortive 
      RNA initiating complex, which results in increasing the activation energy of the 
      transition state before the elongation complex. The results demonstrate for the 
      first time that a DNA-binding regulatory protein acts as an activator or a 
      repressor in different steps of the transcription initiation pathway because of 
      the energetic differences of the intermediate complex in the same promoter.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of Crp-dependent catabolite control of gene expression in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 3516-24
AB  - We report here the transcriptome analyses of highly expressed genes that are 
      subject to catabolite repression or activation mediated by the cyclic AMP 
      receptor protein (Crp). The results reveal that many operons encoding enzymes of 
      central carbon metabolic pathways (e.g., Krebs cycle enzymes), as well as 
      transporters and enzymes that initiate carbon metabolism, are subject to direct 
      Crp-mediated catabolite repression. By contrast, few enzyme-encoding genes 
      (direct regulation) but many ribosomal protein- and tRNA-encoding genes (indirect 
      regulation) are subject to Crp-dependent glucose activation. Additionally, Crp 
      mediates strong indirect catabolite repression of many cytoplasmic stress 
      response proteins, including the major chaperone proteins, five ATP-dependent 
      protease complexes, and several cold and heat shock proteins. These results were 
      confirmed by (i) phenotypic analyses, (ii) real-time PCR studies, (iii) reporter 
      gene fusion assays, and (iv) previously published reports about representative 
      genes. The results serve to define and extend our appreciation of the Crp 
      regulon.

TI  - Expression of the chitobiose operon of Escherichia coli is regulated by three 
      transcription factors: NagC, ChbR and CAP.
PG  - 437-49
AB  - The chitobiose operon, chbBCARFG, encodes genes for the transport and degradation 
      of the N-acetylglucosamine disaccharide, chitobiose. Chitobiose is transported by 
      the phosphotransferase system (PTS) producing chitobiose-6P which is hydrolysed 
      to GlcNAc-6P by the chbF gene product and then further degraded by the nagBA gene 
      products. Expression of the chb operon is repressed by NagC, which regulates 
      genes involved in amino sugar metabolism. The inducer for NagC is GlcNAc-6P. NagC 
      binds to two sites separated by 115 bp and the transcription start point of the 
      chb operon lies within the downstream NagC operator. In addition the chb operon 
      encodes its own specific regulator, ChbR, an AraC-type dual repressor-activator, 
      which binds to two direct repeats of 19 bp located between the two NagC sites. 
      ChbR is necessary for transcription activation in the presence of chitobiose in 
      vivo. Induction of the operon also requires CAP, which binds to a site upstream 
      of the ChbR repeats. In the absence of chitobiose both NagC and ChbR act as 
      repressors. Together these three factors cooperate in switching chb expression 
      from the repressed to the activated state. The need for two specific inducing 
      signals, one for ChbR to activate the expression of the operon and a second for 
      NagC to relieve its repression, ensure that the chb operon is only induced when 
      there is sufficient flux through the combined chb-nag metabolic pathway to 
      activate expression of both the chb and nag operons.

TI  - [Structural-functional analysis of the promoter region of Escherichia coli udp 
      gene].
PG  - 15-25
AB  - Effect of mutations in the -10 and -35 regions of the udp gene promoter on the 
      nature of its regulation by CytR and CRP proteins was studied. In studies of 
      expression of mutant promoters, competition between RNA polymerase and the CytR 
      repressor for the promoter region of the udp gene was shown. In the presence of 
      the improved -10 region, the introduction of a substitution 15C-->T (that is the 
      presence of the elongated Pribnow block) resulted in the CRP-independent 
      transcription of the udp gene promoter. The binding site CRP2 was shown to be 
      indispensable for the maximum promoter activation by the transcription-activating 
      cAMP-CRP complex. Both positive (cAMP-CRP complex) and negative (CytR) regulation 
      of the promoter was virtually fully abolished after the introduction of mutations 
      leading to the creation of canonical sequences in -10 and -35 promoter regions.

TI  - DNA interaction and phosphotransfer of the C4-dicarboxylate-responsive DcuS-DcuR 
      two-component regulatory system from Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1879-89
AB  - The DcuS-DcuR system of Escherichia coli is a two-component sensor-regulator that 
      controls gene expression in response to external C(4)-dicarboxylates and citrate. 
      The DcuS protein is particularly interesting since it contains two PAS domains, 
      namely a periplasmic C(4)-dicarboxylate-sensing PAS domain (PASp) and a cytosolic 
      PAS domain (PASc) of uncertain function. For a study of the role of the PASc 
      domain, three different fragments of DcuS were overproduced and examined: they 
      were PASc-kinase, PASc, and kinase. The two kinase-domain-containing fragments 
      were autophosphorylated by [gamma-(32)P]ATP. The rate was not affected by 
      fumarate or succinate, supporting the role of the PASp domain in 
      C(4)-dicarboxylate sensing. Both of the phosphorylated DcuS constructs were able 
      to rapidly pass their phosphoryl groups to DcuR, and after phosphorylation, DcuR 
      dephosphorylated rapidly. No prosthetic group or significant quantity of metal 
      was found associated with either of the PASc-containing proteins. The DNA-binding 
      specificity of DcuR was studied by use of the pure protein. It was found to be 
      converted from a monomer to a dimer upon acetylphosphate treatment, and native 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggested that it can oligomerize. DcuR 
      specifically bound to the promoters of the three known DcuSR-regulated genes 
      (dctA, dcuB, and frdA), with apparent K(D)s of 6 to 32 micro M for untreated DcuR 
      and < or =1 to 2 microM for the acetylphosphate-treated form. The binding sites 
      were located by DNase I footprinting, allowing a putative DcuR-binding motif 
      [tandemly repeated (T/A)(A/T)(T/C)(A/T)AA sequences] to be identified. The 
      DcuR-binding sites of the dcuB, dctA, and frdA genes were located 27, 94, and 86 
      bp, respectively, upstream of the corresponding +1 sites, and a new promoter was 
      identified for dcuB that responds to DcuR.

TI  - Regulation of expression of the divergent ulaG and ulaABCDEF operons involved in 
      LaAscorbate dissimilation in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1720-8
AB  - The ula regulon, responsible for the utilization of L-ascorbate in Escherichia 
      coli, is formed by two divergently transcribed operons, ulaG and ulaABCDEF. The 
      regulon is negatively regulated by a repressor of the DeoR family which is 
      encoded by the constitutive gene ulaR located downstream of ulaG. Full repression 
      of the ula regulon requires simultaneous interaction of the repressor with both 
      divergent promoters and seems to be dependent on repressor-mediated DNA loop 
      formation, which is helped by the action of integration host factor. Two operator 
      sites have been identified in each promoter. Lack of either of the two sets of 
      operators partially relieved the repression of the other operon; thus, each 
      promoter is dependent on the UlaR operator sites of the other promoter to enhance 
      repression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified UlaR protein and 
      promoter deletion analyses revealed a conserved sequence, present in each of the 
      four operators, acting as a UlaR binding site. Glucose represses the ula regulon 
      via at least two mechanisms, one dependent on cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor 
      protein (CRP) and the other (possibly inducer exclusion) independent of it. 
      Glucose effects mediated by other global regulators cannot be ruled out with the 
      present information. Changes in cAMP-CRP levels affected only the expression of 
      the ulaABCDEF operon.

TI  - Regulation of Escherichia coli hemolysin E expression by H-NS and Salmonella 
      SlyA.
PG  - 1620-8
AB  - The Escherichia coli hlyE gene (also known as clyA or sheA) codes for a novel 
      pore-forming toxin. Previous work has shown that the global transcription factors 
      FNR and CRP positively regulate hlyE expression by binding at the same site. Here 
      in vivo transcription studies reveal that FNR occupies the hlyE promoter more 
      frequently than CRP, providing a mechanism for the moderate upregulation of hlyE 
      expression in response to two distinct environmental signals (oxygen and glucose 
      starvation). It has been reported that H-NS interacts with two large regions of 
      the hlyE promoter (PhlyE), one upstream of the -35 element and one downstream of 
      the -10 element. Here we identify two high-affinity H-NS sites, H-NS I, located 
      at the 3' end of the extended upstream footprint, and H-NS II, located at the 5' 
      end of the extended downstream footprint. It is suggested that these 
      high-affinity sites initiate the progressive formation of higher order complexes, 
      allowing a range of H-NS-mediated regulatory effects at PhlyE. Finally, the 
      identification of a SlyA binding site that overlaps the H-NS I site in PhlyE 
      suggests a mechanism to explain how SlyA overproduction enhances hlyE expression 
      by antagonizing the negative effects of H-NS.

TI  - Transcriptional organization and regulation of the L-idonic acid pathway (GntII 
      system) in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1388-97
AB  - The genetic organization of the idn genes that encode the pathway for L-idonate 
      catabolism was characterized. The monocistronic idnK gene is transcribed 
      divergently from the idnDOTR genes, which were shown to form an operon. The 
      215-bp regulatory region between the idnK and idnD genes contains promoters in 
      opposite orientation with transcription start sites that mapped to positions -26 
      and -29 with respect to the start codons. The regulatory region also contains a 
      single putative IdnR/GntR binding site centered between the two promoters, a CRP 
      binding site upstream of idnD, and an UP element upstream of idnK. The genes of 
      the L-idonate pathway were shown to be under catabolite repression control. 
      Analysis of idnD- and idnK-lacZ fusions in a nonpolar idnD mutant that is unable 
      to interconvert L-idonate and 5-ketogluconate indicated that either compound 
      could induce the pathway. The L-idonate pathway was first characterized as a 
      subsidiary pathway for D-gluconate catabolism (GntII), which is induced by 
      D-gluconate in a GntI (primary gluconate system) mutant. Here we showed that the 
      idnK and idnD operons are induced by D-gluconate in a GntI system mutant, 
      presumably by endogenous formation of 5-ketogluconate from D-gluconate. Thus, the 
      regulation of the GntII system is appropriate for this pathway, which is 
      primarily involved in L-idonate catabolism; the GntII system can be induced by 
      D-gluconate under conditions that block the GntI system.

TI  - Application of AgaR repressor and dominant repressor variants for verification of 
      a gene cluster involved in N-acetylgalactosamine metabolism in Escherichia coli 
      K-12.
PG  - 813-26
AB  - The agaZVWEFASYBCDI gene cluster encodes the phosphotransferase systems and 
      enzymes responsible for the uptake and metabolism of N-acetylgalactosamine and 
      galactosamine in Escherichia coli. In some strains of E. coli, particularly the 
      common K-12 strain, a portion of this cluster is missing because of a 
      site-specific recombination event that occurred between sites in agaW and agaA. 
      Strains that have undergone this recombination event have lost the ability to 
      utilize either N-acetylgalactosamine or galactosamine as sole sources of carbon. 
      Divergently transcribed from this gene cluster is the gene agaR encoding a 
      transcriptional repressor belonging to the DeoR/GlpR family of transcriptional 
      regulators. Promoters upstream of agaR, agaZ and agaS were characterized. All 
      three promoters had elevated activity in the presence of N-acetylgalactosamine or 
      galactosamine, were regulated in vivo by AgaR and possessed specific DNA-binding 
      sites for AgaR upstream from the start sites of transcription as determined by 
      DNase I footprinting. In vivo analysis and DNase I footprinting indicated that 
      the promoter specific for agaZ also requires activation by cAMP-CRP. Previous 
      work with GlpR and other members of the DeoR/GlpR family have identified highly 
      conserved amino acid residues that function in DNA-binding or response to 
      inducer. These residues of AgaR were targeted for site-directed mutagenesis and 
      yielded variants of AgaR that were either negatively dominant or non-inducible. 
      The apparent ability to produce negatively dominant and non-inducible variants of 
      proteins of the DeoR/GlpR family of currently unknown function will likely 
      facilitate screening for function.

TI  - Expression and regulation of a silent operon, hyf, coding for hydrogenase 4 
      isoenzyme in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 580-7
AB  - On the basis of hyf-lacZ fusion studies, the hyf operon of Escherichia coli, 
      noted for encoding the fourth hydrogenase isoenzyme (HYD4), is not expressed at a 
      significant level in a wild-type strain. However, mutant FhlA proteins 
      (constitutive activators of the hyc-encoded hydrogenase 3 isoenzyme) activated 
      hyf-lacZ. HyfR, an FhlA homolog encoded by the hyfR gene present at the end of 
      the hyf operon, also activated transcription of hyf-lacZ but did so only when 
      hyfR was expressed from a heterologous promoter. The HYD4 isoenzyme did not 
      substitute for HYD3 in H(2) production. Optimum expression of hyf-lacZ required 
      the presence of cyclic AMP receptor protein-cyclic AMP complex and anaerobic 
      conditions when HyfR was the activator.

TI  - Phylogeny of the bacterial superfamily of Crp-Fnr transcription regulators: 
      exploiting the metabolic spectrum by controlling alternative gene programs.
PG  - 559-92
AB  - The Crp-Fnr regulators, named after the first two identified members, are 
      DNA-binding proteins which predominantly function as positive transcription 
      factors, though roles of repressors are also important. Among over 1200 proteins 
      with an N-terminally located nucleotide-binding domain similar to the cyclic 
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein, the distinctive additional trait 
      of the Crp-Fnr superfamily is a C-terminally located helix-turn-helix motif for 
      DNA binding. From a curated database of 369 family members exhibiting both 
      features, we provide a protein tree of Crp-Fnr proteins according to their 
      phylogenetic relationships. This results in the assembly of the regulators ArcR, 
      CooA, CprK, Crp, Dnr, FixK, Flp, Fnr, FnrN, MalR, NnrR, NtcA, PrfA, and YeiL and 
      their homologs in distinct clusters. Lead members and representatives of these 
      groups are described, placing emphasis on the less well-known regulators and 
      target processes. Several more groups consist of sequence-derived proteins of 
      unknown physiological roles; some of them are tight clusters of highly similar 
      members. The Crp-Fnr regulators stand out in responding to a broad spectrum of 
      intracellular and exogenous signals such as cAMP, anoxia, the redox state, 
      oxidative and nitrosative stress, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, 2-oxoglutarate, 
      or temperature. To accomplish their roles, Crp-Fnr members have intrinsic sensory 
      modules allowing the binding of allosteric effector molecules, or have prosthetic 
      groups for the interaction with the signal. The regulatory adaptability and 
      structural flexibility represented in the Crp-Fnr scaffold has led to the 
      evolution of an important group of physiologically versatile transcription 
      factors.

TI  - Dual control by regulators, GntH and GntR, of the GntII genes for gluconate 
      metabolism in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 41-56
AB  - Escherichia coli possesses two systems, GntI and GntII, for gluconate uptake and 
      catabolism, whose genes are regulated by GntR as a repressor and GntH as an 
      activator, respectively. Additionally, GntH exerts negative control of the GntI 
      genes via the same binding element as that of GntR. We thus examined whether GntR 
      involves regulation of the GntII genes or not. This regulation and the control by 
      GntH were examined by using single-copy LACZ operon fusions and by RT-PCR, 
      suggesting positive and negative regulation by GntR and positive regulation by 
      GntH. Moreover, the introduction of mutations into possible GntR-binding elements 
      revealed that both regulators share at least one of the elements. The results 
      presented allow us to speculate that GntR initiates expression of the GntII 
      genes, followed by their large induction by GntH when cells were grown in 
      gluconate minimum medium. As in the case of the GntI genes, such a 
      cross-regulation between the GntI and GntII via the two regulators may be 
      important for cells to grow with gluconate.

TI  - Comparison of the structure and regulation of the udp gene of Vibrio cholerae, 
      Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Escherichia coli.
PG  - 510-20
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of the udp gene encoding uridine phosphorylase of 
      Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Vibrio cholerae are presented and compared with 
      the udp sequences of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Both genes 
      contain 759 bases and encode a 253 amino acid polypeptide, which is the same as 
      for E. coli and S. typhimurium. The amino acid sequence derived from S. 
      typhimurium gene was more similar to the derived E. coli sequence, with only a 7 
      amino acid difference. The Y. pseudotuberculosis and V. cholerae uridine 
      phosphorylases presented a higher degree of divergence in their amino acid 
      sequence as compared to the corresponding E. coli amino acid sequence, with 20 
      and 64 changes, respectively. The promoter regions of the udp gene for S. 
      typhimurium (udpPSt), Y. pseudotuberculosis (udpPYp) and V. cholerae (udpPVc) 
      were identified by primer extension analysis. Comparative analysis of the udpP 
      promoter region from Y. pseudotuberculosis, V. cholerae, S. typhimurium and E. 
      coli revealed that location, spacing and orientation of putative binding sites 
      for CRP protein are highly conserved, whereas CytR protein recognition sequences 
      of udpPYp and udpPVc deviate markedly from the E. coli and S. typhimurium CytR 
      binding site. In vitro studies demonstrated that the CytR protein from E. coli 
      shows different affinity for each promoter region analyzed. According to this, 
      the degree of CytR derepression after introduction of heterologous promoters into 
      E. coli cells is different.

TI  - Cyclic AMP receptor protein-dependent activation of the Escherichia coli acsP2 
      promoter by a synergistic class III mechanism.
PG  - 5148-57
AB  - The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) activates transcription of the Escherichia 
      coli acs gene, which encodes an acetate-scavenging enzyme required for fitness 
      during periods of carbon starvation. Two promoters direct transcription of acs, 
      the distal acsP1 and the proximal acsP2. In this study, we demonstrated that 
      acsP2 can function as the major promoter and showed by in vitro studies that CRP 
      facilitates transcription by "focusing" RNA polymerase to acsP2. We proposed that 
      CRP activates transcription from acsP2 by a synergistic class III mechanism. 
      Consistent with this proposal, we showed that CRP binds two sites, CRP I and CRP 
      II. Induction of acs expression absolutely required CRP I, while optimal 
      expression required both CRP I and CRP II. The locations of these DNA sites for 
      CRP (centered at positions -69.5 and -122.5, respectively) suggest that CRP 
      interacts with RNA polymerase through class I interactions. In support of this 
      hypothesis, we demonstrated that acs transcription requires the surfaces of CRP 
      and the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase holoenzyme 
      (alpha-CTD), which is known to participate in class I interactions: activating 
      region 1 of CRP and the 287, 265, and 261 determinants of the alpha-CTD. Other 
      surface-exposed residues in the alpha-CTD contributed to acs transcription, 
      suggesting that the alpha-CTD may interact with at least one protein other than 
      CRP.

TI  - Regulation of sialic acid catabolism by the DNA binding protein NanR in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 4806-15
AB  - All Escherichia coli strains so far examined possess a chromosomally encoded 
      nanATEK-yhcH operon for the catabolism of sialic acids. These unique nine-carbon 
      sugars are synthesized primarily by higher eukaryotes and can be used as carbon, 
      nitrogen, and energy sources by a variety of microbial pathogens or commensals. 
      The gene nanR, located immediately upstream of the operon, encodes a protein of 
      the FadR/GntR family that represses nan expression in trans. S1 analysis 
      identified the nan transcriptional start, and DNA footprint analysis showed that 
      NanR binds to a region of approximately 30 bp covering the promoter region. 
      Native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and 
      chemical cross-linking indicated that NanR forms homodimers in solution. The 
      region protected by NanR contains three tandem repeats of the hexameric sequence 
      GGTATA. Gel shift analysis with purified hexahistidine-tagged or native NanR 
      detected three retarded complexes, suggesting that NanR binds sequentially to the 
      three repeats. Artificial operators carrying different numbers of repeats formed 
      the corresponding number of complexes. Among the sugars tested that were 
      predicted to be products of the nan-encoded system, only the exogenous addition 
      of sialic acid resulted in the dramatic induction of a chromosomal nanA-lacZ 
      fusion or displaced NanR from its operator in vitro. Titration of NanR by the nan 
      promoter region or artificial operators carrying different numbers of the GGTATA 
      repeat on plasmids in this fusion strain supported the binding of the regulator 
      to target DNA in vivo. Together, the results indicate that GGTATA is important 
      for NanR binding, but the precise mechanism remains to be determined.

TI  - Kinetics of transcription initiation at lacP1. Multiple roles of cyclic AMP 
      receptor protein.
PG  - 39755-61
AB  - The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) acts as a transcription activator at many 
      promoters of Escherichia coli. We have examined the kinetics of open complex 
      formation at the lacP1 promoter using tryptophan fluorescence of RNA polymerase 
      and DNA fragments with 2-aminopurine substituted at specific positions. Apart 
      from the closed complex formation and promoter clearance, we were able to detect 
      three steps. The first step after the closed complex formation leads to a rapid 
      increase of 2-aminopurine fluorescence. This was followed by another rapid step 
      in which quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of RNA polymerase was observed. The 
      slowest step detected by 2-aminopurine fluorescence increase is assigned to the 
      final open complex formation. We have found that CRP not only enhances RNA 
      polymerase binding at the promoter, but also enhances the slowest isomerization 
      step by about 2-fold. Furthermore, potassium permanganate probing shows that the 
      conformation of the open complex in the presence of CRP appears qualitatively and 
      quantitatively different from that in the absence of CRP, suggesting that contact 
      with RNA polymerase is maintained throughout the transcription initiation.

TI  - CsrA regulates translation of the Escherichia coli carbon starvation gene, cstA, 
      by blocking ribosome access to the cstA transcript.
PG  - 4450-60
AB  - CsrA is a global regulator that binds to two sites in the glgCAP leader 
      transcript, thereby blocking ribosome access to the glgC Shine-Dalgarno sequence. 
      The upstream CsrA binding site (GCACACGGAU) was used to search the Escherichia 
      coli genomic sequence for other genes that might be regulated by CsrA. cstA 
      contained an exact match that overlapped its Shine-Dalgarno sequence. cstA was 
      previously shown to be induced by carbon starvation and to encode a peptide 
      transporter. Expression of a cstA'-'lacZ translational fusion in wild-type and 
      csrA mutant strains was examined. Expression levels in the csrA mutant were 
      approximately twofold higher when cells were grown in Luria broth (LB) and 5- to 
      10-fold higher when LB was supplemented with glucose. It was previously shown 
      that cstA is regulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein complex and 
      transcribed by Esigma(70). We investigated the influence of sigma(S) on cstA 
      expression and found that a sigma(S) deficiency resulted in a threefold increase 
      in cstA expression in wild-type and csrA mutant strains; however, CsrA-dependent 
      regulation was retained. The mechanism of CsrA-mediated cstA regulation was also 
      examined in vitro. Cross-linking studies demonstrated that CsrA is a homodimer. 
      Gel mobility shift results showed that CsrA binds specifically to cstA RNA, while 
      coupled-transcription-translation and toeprint studies demonstrated that CsrA 
      regulates CstA synthesis by inhibiting ribosome binding to cstA transcripts. RNA 
      footprint and boundary analyses revealed three or four CsrA binding sites, one of 
      which overlaps the cstA Shine-Dalgarno sequence, as predicted. These results 
      establish that CsrA regulates translation of cstA by sterically interfering with 
      ribosome binding.

TI  - Regulation of the mhp cluster responsible for 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid 
      degradation in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 27575-85
AB  - The mhp gene cluster from Escherichia coli constitutes a model system to study 
      bacterial degradation of 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (3HPP). In this work 
      the regulation of the inducible mhp catabolic genes has been studied by genetic 
      and biochemical approaches. The Pr and Pa promoters, which control the expression 
      of the divergently transcribed mhpR regulatory gene and mhp catabolic genes, 
      respectively, show a peculiar arrangement leading to transcripts that are 
      complementary at their 5'-ends. By using Pr-lacZ and Pa-lacZ translational 
      fusions and gel retardation assays, we have shown that the mhpR gene product 
      behaves as a 3HPP-dependent activator of the Pa promoter, being the expression 
      from Pr constitutive and MhpR-independent. DNase I footprinting experiments and 
      mutational analysis mapped an MhpR-protected region, centered at position -58 
      with respect to the Pa transcription start site, which is indispensable for MhpR 
      binding and in vivo activation of the Pa promoter. Superimposed in the specific 
      MhpR-mediated regulation of the Pa promoter, we have observed a strict catabolite 
      repression control carried out by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) that allows 
      expression of the mhp catabolic genes when the preferred carbon source (glucose) 
      is not available and 3HPP is present in the medium. Gel retardation assays 
      revealed that the specific activator, MhpR, is essential for the binding of the 
      second activator, CRP, to the Pa promoter. Such peculiar synergistic 
      transcription activation has not yet been observed in other aromatic catabolic 
      pathways, and the MhpR activator becomes the first member of the IclR family of 
      transcriptional regulators that is indispensable for recruiting CRP to the target 
      promoter.

TI  - Transcription regulation coupling of the divergent argG and metY promoters in 
      Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 3139-46
AB  - The cAMP-catabolite activator protein (CAP) complex is a pleiotropic regulator 
      that regulates a vast number of Escherichia coli genes, including those involved 
      in carbon metabolism. We identified two new targets of this complex: argG, which 
      encodes the arginosuccinate synthase involved in the arginine biosynthetic 
      pathway, and metY, which encodes one of the two methionine tRNA initiators, 
      tRNAf2Met. The cAMP-CAP complex activates argG transcription and inhibits metY 
      transcription from the same DNA position. We also show that ArgR, the specific 
      repressor of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, together with its arginine 
      cofactor, acts on the regulation of metY mediated by CAP. The regulation of the 
      two divergent promoters is thus simultaneously controlled not only by the 
      cAMP-CAP complex, a global regulator, but also by a specific regulator of 
      arginine metabolism, suggesting a previously unsuspected link between carbon 
      metabolism and translation initiation.

TI  - Role of protein-protein bridging interactions on cooperative assembly of 
      DNA-bound CRP-CytR-CRP complex and regulation of the Escherichia coli CytR 
      regulon.
PG  - 3812-25
AB  - The unlinked operons that comprise the Escherichia coli CytR regulon are 
      controlled coordinately through interactions between two gene regulatory 
      proteins, the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and the cytidine repressor (CytR). CytR 
      controls the balance between CRP-mediated recruitment and activation of RNA 
      polymerase and transcriptional repression. Cooperative interactions between CytR, 
      when bound to an operator (CytO) located upstream of a CytR-regulated promoter, 
      and CRP, when bound to flanking tandem promoters, are critical to the regulatory 
      role of CytR. When CytR binds cytidine, cooperativity is reduced resulting in 
      increased transcriptional activity. However, this cytidine-mediated effect varies 
      among promoters, suggesting that coupling between cytidine binding to CytR and 
      CytR-CRP association is sensitive to promoter structure. To investigate the 
      chemical and structural basis for these effects, we investigated how cytidine 
      binding affects association between CytR and CRP in solution and how it affects 
      the binding of CytR deletion mutants lacking the DNA binding HTH domain, with 
      tandem CRP dimers bound to either udpP or deoP2. Deletion mutants that, as we 
      show here, retain the native functions of the allosteric, inducer-binding domain 
      but do not bind DNA were expressed and purified. We refer to these as Core 
      domain. Despite only weak association between CytR and CRP in solution, our 
      results demonstrate the formation of a relatively stable complex in which the 
      Core domain forms a protein bridge between tandem CRP dimers when bound to either 
      udpP or deoP2. The DeltaG(o) for bridge complex formation is about -7.8 kcal/mol. 
      This is well in excess of that required to account for cooperativity (-2.5 to -3 
      kcal/mol). The bridge complexes are significantly destabilized by cytidine 
      binding, and to the same extent in both promoter complexes (DeltaDeltaG(o) 
      approximately +2 kcal/mol). Even with this destabilization, DeltaG(o) for bridge 
      complex formation by cytidine-liganded Core domain is still sufficient by itself 
      to account for cooperativity. These findings demonstrate that direct coupling 
      between cytidine binding to CytR and CytR-CRP association does not account for 
      promoter-specific effects on cooperativity. Instead, cytidine binding must induce 
      a CytR conformation that is more rigid or in some other way less tolerant of the 
      variation in the geometric arrangement of operator sites between different 
      promoters.

TI  - The ascorbate transporter of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 2243-50
AB  - The sgaTBA genes of Escherichia coli encode a putative 12-transmembrane 
      alpha-helical segment (12 TMS) transporter, an enzyme IIB-like protein and an 
      enzyme IIA-like protein of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), respectively. We 
      show that all three proteins as well as the energy-coupling PTS proteins, enzyme 
      I and HPr, are required for the anaerobic utilization and uptake of L-ascorbate 
      in vivo and its phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation in vitro. The 
      transporter exhibits an apparent K(m) for L-ascorbate of 9 micro M and is highly 
      specific. The sgaTBA genes are regulated at the transcriptional level by the yjfQ 
      gene product, as well as by Crp and Fnr. The yjfR gene product is essential for 
      L-ascorbate utilization and probably encodes a cytoplasmic L-ascorbate 
      6-phosphate lactonase. We conclude that SgaT represents a novel prototypical 
      enzyme IIC that functions with SgaA and SgaB to allow phosphoryl transfer from 
      HPr(his-P) to L-ascorbate via the phosphoryl transfer pathway: [pathway: see 
      text].

TI  - Selective regulation of ptsG expression by Fis. Formation of either activating or 
      repressing nucleoprotein complex in response to glucose.
PG  - 14776-81
AB  - Transcription of ptsG encoding glucose-specific permease, enzyme IICB(Glc), in 
      Escherichia coli is initiated from two promoters, P1 and P2. ptsG transcription 
      is repressed by Mlc, a glucose-inducible regulator of carbohydrate metabolism. 
      The regulation of ptsG P1 transcription is also under positive control by cyclic 
      AMP receptor protein and cyclic AMP complex (CRP.cAMP) as observed in other Mlc 
      regulon. We report here that Fis, one of the nucleoid-associated proteins, plays 
      a key role in glucose induction of Mlc regulon. ptsG transcription was induced 
      when wild-type cells were grown in the presence of glucose. However, in a fis 
      mutant, the basal level of ptsG transcription was higher but decreased when cells 
      were grown in the presence of glucose, which implies the possibility of 
      regulatory interactions among Fis, Mlc, and CRP.cAMP. Footprinting experiments 
      with various probes and transcription assays revealed that Fis assists both Mlc 
      repression and CRP.cAMP activation of ptsG P1 through the formation of 
      Fis.CRP.Mlc or Fis.CRP nucleoprotein complexes at ptsG P1 promoter depending on 
      the availability of glucose in the growth medium. ptsG P2 transcription was 
      inhibited by Fis and Mlc. Tighter Mlc repression and enhanced CRP.cAMP activation 
      of ptsG P1 by Fis enable cells to regulate Mlc regulon efficiently by selectively 
      controlling the concentration of enzyme IICB(Glc) that modulates Mlc activity.

TI  - [Functional interrelationship between elements of the Escherichia coli udp gene 
      promotor responsible for binding regulatory proteins CytR, CRP, and RNA 
      polymerase].
PG  - 1223-34
AB  - Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted in the regulatory region of the 
      Escherichia coli udp gene at promoter sites responsible for binding regulatory 
      proteins CRP and CytR as well as RNA polymerase (the core-promoter containing 
      the--10 sequence). In mutants with an "improved"--10 region, a partial relief 
      from the control of the cAMP-CRP transcription activation complex occurred, and 
      the negative CytR repressor regulation was reduced. In contrast, mutant promoters 
      with a weak Pribnow block or with a deletion that completely eliminates the 
      core-promoter exhibited an increased ability to titrate the CytR protein in vivo. 
      On the other hand, the affinity of CytR for DNA in mutants with an altered--10 
      region was the same as in the wild-type udp promoter. After introduction of 
      mutations affecting binding sites for CRP (CRP1 and CRP2), the negative effect of 
      the CytR protein on promoter transcription was fully abolished. The CRP1 binding 
      site was shown to play the main role in the activation of the promoter by the 
      cAMP-CRP complex, whereas the CRP2 site participates in the formation of the 
      repressor complex. Mutations in the main and additional CytR binding sites were 
      isolated and characterized. On the basis of these data, it is concluded that the 
      modification of each structural element of the udp regulatory region (binding 
      sites for CytR, CRP, or RNA polymerase) caused changes in the overall pattern of 
      the promoter regulation.

      polymerase alpha subunit carboxyl-terminal domain (alphaCTD). We determined the 
      crystal structure of the CAP-alphaCTD-DNA complex at a resolution of 3.1 
      angstroms. CAP makes direct protein-protein interactions with alphaCTD, and 
      alphaCTD makes direct protein-DNA interactions with the DNA segment adjacent to 
      the DNA site for CAP. There are no large-scale conformational changes in CAP and 
      alphaCTD, and the interface between CAP and alphaCTD is small. These findings are 
      consistent with the proposal that activation involves a simple "recruitment" 
      mechanism.

TI  - Catabolite repression of Escherichia coli biofilm formation.
PG  - 3406-10
AB  - Biofilm formation was repressed by glucose in several species of 
      Enterobacteriaceae. In Escherichia coli, this effect was mediated at least in 
      part by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein. A temporal role for cAMP in 
      biofilm development was indicated by the finding that glucose addition after 
      approximately 24 h failed to repress and generally activated biofilm formation.

TI  - Architectural requirements for optimal activation by tandem CRP molecules at a 
      class I CRP-dependent promoter.
PG  - 55-60
AB  - The Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) activates transcription at 
      target promoters by interacting with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase 
      alpha subunit. We have constructed a set of promoters carrying tandem DNA sites 
      for CRP with one site centred at position -61.5 and the other site located at 
      different upstream positions. Optimal CRP-dependent activation of transcription 
      is observed when the upstream DNA site for CRP is located at position -93.5 or at 
      position -103.5. Evidence is presented to suggest that activation by the 
      upstream-bound CRP molecule is due to interaction with the C-terminal domain of 
      the RNA polymerase alpha subunit.

TI  - Structure of the Lrp-regulated serA promoter of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 323-33
AB  - Expression of the Escherichia coli serA gene is activated in vivo by the product 
      of the lrp gene, leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp), an effect partially 
      reversed by L-leucine. We show here that serA is transcribed from two promoters, 
      P1 45 bp upstream of the translation start site, and P2 92 bp further upstream. 
      Lrp binds to a long AT-rich sequence from -158 to -82 from the start of the 
      coding region, i.e. upstream of P1 and overlapping P2. It activates transcription 
      from P1 and represses expression from P2. A second regulator, cAMP/CRP, activates 
      P2, an effect that is largely inhibited by Lrp, such that catabolite repressor 
      protein (Crp) and Lrp are rival activators of serA transcription.

TI  - Mutational scanning and affinity cleavage analysis of UhpA-binding sites in the 
      Escherichia coli uhpT promoter.
PG  - 2682-91
AB  - UhpA, a member of the NarL family of response regulators, activates transcription 
      of the Escherichia coli uhpT gene for the sugar phosphate transporter UhpT in 
      response to extracellular glucose-6-phosphate. UhpA binds with different 
      affinities to adjacent regions in the uhpT promoter, termed the strong-binding 
      (S) region from -80 to -50 and the weak-binding (W) region from -50 to -32. 
      Transcription activation by UhpA is stimulated by the catabolite gene activator 
      protein (CAP)-cyclic AMP complex and depends on the C-terminal domains of the RNA 
      polymerase RpoA and RpoD subunits. Because single-base substitutions in the 
      UhpA-binding region had little effect on promoter activity, nucleotide 
      substitutions in successive 4-bp blocks throughout this region were examined for 
      their effects on promoter activation and UhpA binding. Changes in three of four 
      blocks within the W region substantially impaired the ability of UhpA to bind to 
      this region, to drive expression of a uhpT-lacZ reporter, and to support 
      UhpA-dependent in vitro transcription. These W region variant promoters were 
      strongly stimulated by CAP. Changes in several parts of the S region impaired 
      UhpA binding to both the S and W regions and decreased promoter activity in vivo 
      and in vitro. Thus, binding of UhpA to the W region is crucial for UhpA-dependent 
      activation and depends on occupancy of the S region. None of these substitutions 
      eliminated promoter function. The orientation of UhpA-binding sites was assessed 
      by the affinity cleavage method. The iron chelate FeBABE [iron 
      (S)-1-(p-bromoacetamidobenzyl) EDTA] was covalently attached to engineered 
      cysteine residues near the DNA-binding region in UhpA. Hydroxyl radicals 
      generated by the iron chelate attached at position 187 resulted in DNA strand 
      cleavages in two clusters of sites located in the middle of the S and W regions. 
      These results are consistent with the binding of two dimers of UhpA. Each dimer 
      binds to an inverted repeat of monomer-binding sites with the consensus sequence 
      CCTGRR, where R is A or G, and each is separated by 6 bp. It is likely that 
      members of the NarL family bind to dyad targets, in contrast to the binding of 
      OmpR family response regulators to direct-repeat targets.

TI  - Binding of enzyme IIAGlc, a component of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar 
      phosphotransferase system, to the Escherichia coli lactose permease.
PG  - 5556-65
AB  - Enzyme IIA(Glc), encoded by the crr gene of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar 
      phosphotransferase system, plays an important role in regulating intermediary 
      metabolism in Escherichia coli ("catabolite repression"). One function involves 
      inhibition of inducible transport systems ("inducer exclusion"), and with lactose 
      permease, a galactoside is required for unphosphorylated IIA(Glc) binding to 
      cytoplasmic loops IV/V and VI/VII [Sondej, M., Sun, J. et al. (1999) Proc. Natl. 
      Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 96, 3525-3530]. With inside-out membrane vesicles containing 
      the permease, [(125)I]IIA(Glc) binding promoted by melibiose exhibits an affinity 
      (K(D)(IIA)) of approximately 1 microM and a stoichiometry of one mole of IIA(Glc) 
      per six moles of lactose permease. Both the quantity of [(125)I]IIA(Glc) bound 
      and the sugar concentration required for half-maximal IIA(Glc) binding 
      (K(0.5)(IIA)(sug)) was measured for eight permease substrates. Differences in 
      maximal IIA(Glc) binding are observed, and the K(0.5)(IIA)(sug) does not 
      correlate with the affinity of LacY for sugar. Furthermore, K(0.5)(IIA)(sug) does 
      not correlate with sugar affinities for various permease mutants. IIA(Glc) does 
      not bind to a mutant (Cys154 --> Gly), which is locked in an outwardly facing 
      conformation, binds with increased stoichiometry to mutant Lys131 --> Cys, and 
      binds only weakly to two other mutants which appear to be predominantly in either 
      an outwardly or an inwardly facing conformation. When the latter two mutations 
      are combined, sugar-dependent IIA(Glc) binding returns to near wild-type levels. 
      The findings suggest that binding of various substrates to lactose permease 
      results in a collection of unique conformations, each of which presents a 
      specific surface toward the inner face of the membrane that can interact to 
      varying degrees with IIA(Glc).

TI  - Interaction of cAMP receptor protein from Escherichia coli with cAMP and DNA 
      studied by dynamic light scattering and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy 
      methods.
PG  - 601-10
AB  - Cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) regulates the expression of more than 100 genes 
      in Escherichia coli when complexed with cyclic AMP. Dynamic light scattering 
      (DLS) and fluorescence decay anisotropy measurements of CRP were performed in 
      solution, in the absence and presence of cAMP. We have also measured the effect 
      of DNA sequences, including lac and gal promoter sequences, on the shape of 
      CRP-DNA complexes. DLS measurements show that upon cAMP binding at low nucleotide 
      concentration, the Stokes radius decreases from the value of 2.8 nm for apo-CRP 
      to the value of 2.7 nm. At higher cAMP concentration, only a very small further 
      decrease was detected. Fluorescence anisotropy decay measurements, with the use 
      of CRP labeled at Cys-178 with 1,5-I-AENS, indicate that apo-CRP exhibits two 
      rotational correlation times. The longer time, theta1 = 23.3 ns, corresponds to 
      the overall motion of the protein, and the shorter time, theta2 = 1.4 ns, 
      exhibits segmental mobility of the C-terminal domain of CRP. Binding of cAMP into 
      CRP induced substantial increase of theta1 to the value of 30.7 ns, whereas 
      theta2 remained unchanged. The DLS measurements indicate that the binding of CRP 
      into a fragment of DNA possessing a sequence of lac promoter induces a larger 
      increase in the Stokes radius of lac-CRP complex than in case of gal-CRP complex. 
      Similarly, a higher change was detected in rotational correlation time, theta1, 
      in the case of lac-CRP complex than in case of gal-CRP. Because the lac and gal 
      promoters are characteristic for the two different classes of CRP-dependent 
      promoters, one can expect that the observed differences in lac-CRP and gal-CRP 
      complexes are important in activation of transcription in Escherichia coli.

TI  - Differential control by IHF and cAMP of two oppositely oriented genes, hpt and 
      gcd, in Escherichia coli: significance of their partially overlapping regulatory 
      elements.
PG  - 865-72
AB  - The hpt gene, which encodes hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, is located 
      next to, but transcribed in the opposite direction to, the gcd gene, which codes 
      for a membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase, at 3.1 min on the Escherichia coli 
      genome. In their promoter-operator region, putative regulatory elements for 
      integration host factor (IHF) and for the complex comprising 3', 5'-cyclic AMP 
      (cAMP) and its receptor protein (CRP) are present, and they overlap the promoters 
      for hpt and gcd, respectively. The involvement of IHF and cAMP-CRP, as well as 
      the corresponding putative cis-acting elements, in the expression of the two 
      genes was investigated by using lacZ operon fusions. In an adenylate 
      cyclase-deficient strain, addition of cAMP increased the expression of hpt and 
      reduced the expression of gcd. In agreement with this observation, the 
      introduction of mutations into the putative binding element for the cAMP-CRP 
      complex enhanced the expression of gcd. In contrast, mutations introduced into 
      the putative IHF-binding elements increased the level of hpt expression. Similar 
      results were obtained with IHF-defective strains. Thus, the expression of the two 
      genes is regulated in a mutually exclusive manner. Additional experiments with 
      mutations at the -10 sequence of the gcd promoter suggest that the binding of RNA 
      polymerase to the hpt promoter interferes with the interaction of RNA polymerase 
      with the gcd promoter, and vice versa.

TI  - Computational analysis of the transcriptional regulation of pentose utilization 
      systems in the gamma subdivision of Proteobacteria.
PG  - 315-22
AB  - The comparative approach to the recognition of transcription regulatory sites is 
      based on the assumption that as long as a regulator is conserved in several 
      genomes, one can expect that sets of co-regulated genes (regulons) and regulatory 
      sites for the regulator in these genomes are conserved as well. We used this 
      approach to analyze the ribose (RbsR), arabinose (AraC), and xylose (XylR) 
      regulons of gamma Proteobacteria for which (almost) completely sequenced genomes 
      were available. Candidate binding sites for RbsR and AraC were detected. The 
      improved XylR site consensus was proposed. Potential new members of the xylose 
      regulons were found in the Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Klebsiella 
      pneumoniae genomes. The function of these new xylose-regulated operons is likely 
      to be the utilization of oligosaccharides containing xylose. Finally, candidate 
      cAMP receptor-protein sites were identified in the regulatory regions of the 
      majority of RbsR-, AraC-, and XylR-regulated operons.

TI  - A simple mechanism for co-dependence on two activators at an Escherichia coli 
      promoter.
PG  - 7160-7
AB  - The Escherichia coli melAB promoter is co-dependent upon two transcription 
      activators, MelR and the cyclic AMP receptor protein, CRP. In this study we 
      demonstrate positive co-operativity between the binding of MelR and CRP at the 
      melAB promoter, which provides a simple mechanism for its co-dependence. MelR 
      binds to four sites, centred at positions -42.5, -62.5, -100.5 and -120.5 
      relative to the melAB transcription start point. When MelR is pre-bound, CRP is 
      able to bind to a target located between MelR at positions -62.5 and -100.5. This 
      increases the occupation of the two downstream sites for MelR, which is essential 
      for transcription activation. We have identified residues within activating 
      region 1 (AR1) of CRP that are important in transcription activation of the melAB 
      promoter. At simple CRP-dependent promoters, the surface of CRP containing these 
      residues is involved in contacting the RNA polymerase alpha subunit. Our results 
      show that, at the melAB promoter, the surface of CRP containing AR1 contacts MelR 
      rather than RNA polymerase. Thus, MelR and CRP activate transcription by a novel 
      mechanism in which they bind co-operatively to adjacent sites and form a 
      bacterial enhanceosome.

TI  - Indirect readout of DNA sequence at the primary-kink site in the CAP-DNA complex: 
      alteration of DNA binding specificity through alteration of DNA kinking.
PG  - 75-82
AB  - The catabolite activator protein (CAP) sharply bends DNA in the CAP-DNA complex, 
      introducing a DNA kink, with a roll angle of approximately 40 degrees and a twist 
      angle of approximately 20 degrees, between positions 6 and 7 of the DNA 
      half-site, 5'-A(1)A(2)A(3)T(4)G(5)T(6)G(7)A(8)T(9)C(10)T(11)-3' ("primary kink"). 
      CAP recognizes the base-pair immediately 5' to the primary-kink site, T:A(6), 
      through an "indirect-readout" mechanism involving sequence effects on the 
      energetics of primary-kink formation. CAP recognizes the base-pair immediately 3' 
      to the primary-kink site, G:C(7), through a "direct-readout" mechanism involving 
      formation of a hydrogen bond between Glu181 of CAP and G:C(7). Here, we report 
      that substitution of the carboxylate side-chain of Glu181 of CAP by the 
      one-methylene-group-shorter carboxylate side-chain of Asp changes DNA binding 
      specificity at position 6 of the DNA half site, changing specificity for T:A(6) 
      to specificity for C:G(6), and we report a crystallographic analysis defining the 
      structural basis of the change in specificity. The Glu181-->Asp substitution 
      eliminates the primary kink and thus eliminates indirect-readout-based 
      specificity for T:A(6). The Glu181-->Asp substitution does not eliminate 
      hydrogen-bond formation with G:C(7), and thus does not eliminate 
      direct-readout-based specificity for G:C(7).

TI  - Repression of deoP2 in Escherichia coli by CytR: conversion of a transcription 
      activator into a repressor.
PG  - 5392-9
AB  - In the deoP2 promoter of Escherichia coli, a transcription activator, cAMP-CRP, 
      binds at two sites, centered at -41.5 and -93.5 from the start site of 
      transcription, while a repressor, CytR, binds to a space between the two cAMP-CRP 
      complexes. The mechanisms for the cAMP-CRP-mediated transcription activation and 
      CytR-mediated transcription repression were investigated in vitro using purified 
      components. We classified the deoP2 promoter as a class II cAMP-CRP-dependent 
      promoter, primarily by the action of cAMP-CRP at the downstream site. 
      Interestingly, we also found that deoP2 carries an "UP-element" immediately 
      upstream of the downstream cAMP-CRP site. The UP-element overlaps with the DNA 
      site for CytR. However, it was observed that CytR functions with the RNA 
      polymerase devoid of the C-terminal domain of the alpha-subunit as well as with 
      intact RNA polymerase. The mechanism of repression by CytR proposed in this study 
      is that the cAMP-CRP bound at -41.5 undergoes an allosteric change upon direct 
      interaction with CytR such that it no longer maintains a productive interaction 
      with the N-terminal domain of alpha, but instead acts as a repressor to interfere 
      with RNA polymerase acting on deoP2.

      promoters (glnAp1 and glnAp2). The glnAp1 is a sigma(70)-dependent promoter that 
      is activated by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). Under nitrogen-deficient growth 
      conditions, glnAp1 is repressed by NtrC-phosphate. The downstream glnAp2 promoter 
      is sigma(54)-dependent and is activated by NtrC-phosphate. Here, we show that 
      glnAp2 expression is affected by different carbon sources and that the CRP-cAMP 
      complex inhibits the glnAp2 promoter activity. Primer extension and KMnO4 
      footprinting analysis indicate that the inhibitory effect is at the 
      transcriptional level in vivo. When glnAp2 is activated by NifA, a similar 
      inhibitory effect by CRP-cAMP is observed. Site-directed mutagenesis and deletion 
      analysis indicate that the characterized and putative CRP-binding sites located 
      in the upstream region of the glnAp2 promoter are not essential for the 
      inhibitory effect. CRP-cAMP inhibits sigma(54)-dependent glnAp2 strongly, by 
      21-fold. By activating glnAp1 and downregulating glnAp2, the overall effect of 
      CRP-cAMP on glnA expression is an approximately fourfold reduction, which 
      correlates with the reduction of gamma-glutamyl transferase activities in the 
      cells. We propose therefore that a physiological role of CRP-cAMP activation of 
      glnAp1 is to partially compensate for CRP-cAMP downregulation of glnAp2, allowing 
      a low but non-negligible level of expression of the important genes transcribed 
      from it. A novel regulatory linkage between carbon and nitrogen regulons is 
      proposed.

TI  - Role of activator site position and a distal UP-element half-site for sigma 
      factor selectivity at a CRP/H-NS-activated sigma(s)-dependent promoter in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 705-16
AB  - Transcription initiation by the stress-associated sigma(S)-containing RNA 
      polymerase holoenzyme (E sigma(S)) in Escherichia coli is often subject to 
      complex regulation that involves multiple additional regulators and histone-like 
      proteins. csiD is a stationary phase-inducible sigma(S)-dependent gene in E. coli 
      that requires activation by cAMP-CRP (bound to a site centred at -68.5 
      nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site) and is positively 
      modulated by the abundant nucleoid-associated proteins H-NS and Lrp. By shifting 
      the CRP box to positions between -80.5 and -60.5, we could demonstrate that: (i) 
      activation is equally helix phase dependent as at classic class I promoters; (ii) 
      E sigma(S) prefers a CRP box location at -68.5/-70.5, whereas E sigma(70) is 
      nearly inactive with such an arrangement; and (iii) with the CRP site moved to 
      -60.5, transcription can be initiated efficiently by both holoenzymes. The csiD 
      promoter region also contains a distal UP-element half-site located downstream of 
      the CRP box, as demonstrated by mutational studies, in which this element was 
      either eliminated or completed to a full UP-element. The UP-element half-site 
      favours E sigma(S)-mediated expression, whereas with the full UP-element, nearly 
      wild-type levels of csiD transcription were observed in the absence of sigma(S). 
      Finally, we show that the two histone-like proteins, H-NS and Lrp, both act by 
      influencing activation by cAMP-CRP, but do so by different mechanisms. In 
      particular, H-NS directly or indirectly increases positional stringency for the 
      CRP binding site. The implications of these findings with respect to sigma factor 
      selectivity, activation mechanisms used by the two holoenzymes and the 
      architecture of sigma(S)-dependent promoters are discussed.

TI  - Functional versatility in the CRP-FNR superfamily of transcription factors: FNR 
      and FLP.
PG  - 1-34
AB  - The cAMP receptor protein (CRP; sometimes known as CAP, the catabolite gene 
      activator protein) and the fumarate and nitrate reduction regulator (FNR) of 
      Escherichia coli are founder members of an expanding superfamily of structurally 
      related transcription factors. The archetypal CRP structural fold provides a very 
      versatile mechanism for transducing environmental and metabolic signals to the 
      transcription machinery. It allows different functional specificities at the 
      sensory, DNA-recognition and RNA-polymerase-interaction levels to be 'mixed and 
      matched' in order to create a diverse range of transcription factors tailored to 
      respond to particular physiological conditions. This versatility is clearly 
      illustrated by comparing the properties of the CRP, FNR and FLP (FNR-like 
      protein) regulators. At the sensory level, the basic structural fold has been 
      adapted in FNR and FLP by the acquisition in the N-terminal region of different 
      combinations of cysteine or other residues; which bestow oxygen/redox sensing 
      mechanisms that are poised according to the oxidative stress thresholds affecting 
      the metabolism of specific bacteria. At the DNA-recognition level, discrimination 
      between distinct but related DNA targets is mediated by amino acid sequence 
      modifications in the conserved core contact between the DNA-recognition helix and 
      target DNA. And, at the level of RNA-polymerase-interaction, different 
      combinations of three discrete regions contacting the polymerase (the activating 
      regions) are used for polymerase recruitment and promoting transcription.

TI  - Heat shock RNA polymerase (E sigma(32)) is involved in the transcription of mlc 
      and crucial for induction of the Mlc regulon by glucose in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 25871-5
AB  - Mlc is a global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism. Recent studies have 
      revealed that Mlc is depressed by protein-protein interaction with enzyme 
      IICB(Glc), a glucose-specific permease, which is encoded by ptsG. The mlc gene 
      has been previously known to be transcribed by two promoters, P1(+1) and P2(+13), 
      and have a binding site of its own gene product at +16. However, the mechanism of 
      transcriptional regulation of the gene has not yet been established. In vitro 
      transcription assays of the mlc gene showed that P2 promoter could be recognized 
      by RNA polymerase containing the heat shock sigma factor final sigma(32) (E 
      sigma(32)) as well as E sigma(70), while P1 promoter is only recognized by E 
      sigma(70). The cyclic AMP receptor protein and cyclic AMP complex (CRP.cAMP) 
      increased expression from P2 but showed negative effect on transcription from P1 
      by E sigma(70), although it had little effect on transcription from P2 by E 
      sigma(32) in vitro. Purified Mlc repressed transcription from both promoters, but 
      with different degrees of inhibition. In vivo transcription assays using wild 
      type and mlc strains indicated that the level of mlc expression was modulated 
      less than 2-fold by glucose in the medium with concerted action of CRP.cAMP and 
      Mlc. A dramatic increase in mlc expression was observed upon heat shock or in 
      cells overexpressing final sigma(32), confirming that E sigma(32) is involved in 
      the expression of mlc. Induction of ptsG P1 and pts P0 transcription by glucose 
      was also dependent on E sigma(32). These results indicate that E sigma(32) plays 
      an important role in balancing the relative concentration of Mlc and EIICB(Glc) 
      in response to availability of glucose in order to maintain inducibility of the 
      Mlc regulon at high growth temperature.

TI  - CRP modulates fis transcription by alternate formation of activating and 
      repressing nucleoprotein complexes.
PG  - 17878-86
AB  - The DNA architectural proteins FIS and CRP are global regulators of transcription 
      in Escherichia coli involved in the adjustment of cellular metabolism to varying 
      growth conditions. We have previously demonstrated that FIS modulates the 
      expression of the crp gene by functioning as its transcriptional repressor. Here 
      we show that in turn, CRP is required to maintain the growth phase pattern of fis 
      expression. We demonstrate the existence of a divergent promoter in the fis 
      regulatory region, which reduces transcription of the fis promoter. In the 
      absence of FIS, CRP activates fis transcription, thereby displacing the 
      polymerase from the divergent promoter, whereas together FIS and CRP 
      synergistically repress fis gene expression. These results provide evidence for a 
      direct cross-talk between global regulators of cellular transcription during the 
      growth phase. This cross-talk is manifested in alternate formation of functional 
      nucleoprotein complexes exerting either activating or repressing effects on 
      transcription.

TI  - A novel mechanism controls anaerobic and catabolite regulation of the Escherichia 
      coli tdc operon.
PG  - 1285-98
AB  - The tdc operon is subject to CRP-controlled catabolite repression. Expression of 
      the operon is also induced anaerobically, although this regulation does not rely 
      on direct control by either FNR or ArcA. Recently, the anaerobic expression of 
      the tdc operon was found to be fortuitously induced in the presence of glucose by 
      a heterologous gene isolated from the Gram-positive anaerobe Clostridium 
      butyricum. The gene, termed tcbC, encoded a histone-like protein of 14.5 kDa. 
      Using tdc-lacZ fusions, it was shown that TcbC did not activate tdc expression by 
      functionally replacing any of the operon regulators. In vitro transcription 
      analyses with RNA polymerase and CRP revealed that faithful CRP-dependent 
      transcription initiation occurred only on supercoiled templates. No specific, 
      CRP-dependent transcription initiation was observed on relaxed or linear DNA 
      templates. Surprisingly, purified His-tagged TcbC activated transcription from a 
      relaxed, circular template, but not from supercoiled or linear templates. 
      Examination of the CRP binding site of the tdc promoter revealed that it was 
      located 43.5 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. Repositioning of 
      the CRP site at -41.5 bp abolished activation by the TcbC protein and allowed 
      CRP-dependent transcription to occur on linear, relaxed and supercoiled 
      templates. TcbC bound DNA non-specifically; however, in topoisomerase I 
      relaxation assays, it was demonstrated that TcbC imposed torsional constraints on 
      negatively supercoiled DNA, which influenced the ability of the enzyme to relax 
      the topoisomers. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that TcbC 
      activates transcription of tdc by altering the local topological status of the 
      tdc promoter and that, in the wild-type tdc promoter, the CRP binding site is 
      misaligned to allow transcription to occur only under optimal conditions. Indeed, 
      in vivo transcription analyses revealed that repositioning of the CRP binding 
      site to -41.5 bp resulted in high-level, CRP-dependent transcription, even under 
      catabolite-repressing conditions, and that transcription was no longer influenced 
      by TcbC. Remarkably, however, anaerobic regulation of the mutant promoter was 
      retained. This indicates that the other tdc regulators, TdcA and TdcR, govern 
      anaerobic transcription activation by CRP.

TI  - Escherichia coli acid resistance: cAMP receptor protein and a 20 bp cis-acting 
      sequence control pH and stationary phase expression of the gadA and gadBC 
      glutamate decarboxylase genes.
PG  - 709-715
LID - 10.1099/00221287-147-3-709 [doi]
AB  - Acid resistance is an important feature of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic 
      Escherichia coli. It enables survival in the acidic regions of mammalian 
      gastrointestinal tracts and is largely responsible for the small number of 
      bacteria required for infection/colonization. Three systems of acid resistance 
      have been identified, the most efficient of which requires glutamic acid during 
      pH 2 acid challenge. Three proteins associated with glutamate-dependent acid 
      resistance have been identified. They are glutamate decarboxylase (encompassing 
      two isozymes encoded by gadA and gadB) and a putative glutamate:gamma-amino 
      butyric acid antiporter (encoded by gadC). The results confirm that the GadA and 
      GadB proteins increase in response to stationary phase and low environmental pH. 
      The levels of these proteins correspond to concomitant changes in gadA and gadBC 
      mRNA levels. Fusions between lacZ and the gadA and gadBC operons indicate that 
      this control occurs at the transcriptional level. Western blot, Northern blot and 
      fusion analyses reveal that regulation of these genes is complex. Expression in 
      rich media is restricted to stationary phase. However, in minimal media, acid pH 
      alone can trigger induction in exponential or stationary phase cells. Despite 
      this differential control, there is only one transcriptional start site for each 
      gene. Expression in rich media is largely dependent on the alternate sigma factor 
      sigma(S) and is repressed by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). In contrast, 
      sigma(S) has only a minor role in gad transcription in cells grown in minimal 
      media. Deletions of the regulatory region upstream of gadA provided evidence that 
      a 20 bp conserved region located 50 bp from the transcriptional start of both 
      operons is required for expression.

TI  - Two proteins, YfiA and YhbH, associated with resting ribosomes in stationary 
      phase Escherichia coli.
PG  - 965-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ribosomes in Escherichia coli change their composition and 
      conformation in the stationary phase. Ribosome modulation factor (RMF) and 
      ribosomal protein S22 are known to be associated with stationary phase ribosomes. 
      RMF association causes the loss of translational activity and the dimerization of 
      70S ribosomes into 100S ribosomes, which may increase cell survival in the 
      stationary phase. RESULTS: Two weakly acidic proteins having related amino acid 
      sequences were found to be associated with E. coli ribosomes in the stationary 
      phase. These proteins are the products of ORFs named yfiA and yhbH. The sum of 
      the copy numbers of their product proteins, YfiA and YhbH, in the ribosomal 
      particles was low in the log phase, but increased to nearly one in the stationary 
      phase. YfiA was found in the 70S ribosomal fraction rather than the 100S. On the 
      other hand, YhbH was detected exclusively in the 100S ribosomal fraction. When 
      the stationary phase cells were transferred to fresh medium, YfiA and YhbH were 
      found in the 70S ribosomal fraction, but not in the polysome fraction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Two proteins, YfiA and YhbH, associated with E. coli ribosomes were 
      found to accumulate in the stationary phase, leading to the formation of several 
      types of ribosomes. They are not likely to have roles in the elongation step of 
      the translation in log phase cells, but are likely to be involved in the 
      stabilization and preservation of ribosomes in the stationary phase, which might 
      be necessary for cell survival.

TI  - DNA binding sites for the Mlc and NagC proteins: regulation of nagE, encoding the 
      N-acetylglucosamine-specific transporter in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 506-14
AB  - The NagC and Mlc proteins are homologous transcriptional regulators that control 
      the expression of several phosphotransferase system (PTS) genes in Escherichia 
      coli. NagC represses nagE, encoding the N:-acetylglucosamine-specific 
      transporter, while Mlc represses three PTS operons, ptsG, manXYZ and ptsHIcrr, 
      involved in the uptake of glucose. NagC and Mlc can bind to each others operator, 
      at least in vitro. A binding site selection procedure was used to try to 
      distinguish NagC and Mlc sites. The major difference was that all selected NagC 
      binding sites had a G or a C at positions +11/-11 from the centre of symmetry. 
      This is also the case for most native NagC sites, but not the nagE operator, 
      which thus looks like a potential Mlc target. The nagE operator does exhibit a 
      higher affinity for Mlc than NagC, but no regulation of nagE by physiological 
      concentrations of Mlc was detected in vivo. Regulation of wild-type nagE by NagC 
      is achieved because of the chelation effect due to a second high affinity NagC 
      operator covering the nagB promoter. Replacing the A/T at +11/-11 with C/G allows 
      repression by NagC in the absence of the nagB operator.

TI  - Modeling the cAMP-induced allosteric transition using the crystal structure of 
      CAP-cAMP at 2.1 A resolution.
PG  - 847-59
AB  - After an allosteric transition produced by the binding of cyclic AMP (cAMP), the 
      Escherichia coli catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) binds DNA specifically 
      and activates transcription. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the 
      CAP-cAMP complex has been refined at 2.1 A resolution, thus enabling a better 
      evaluation of the structural basis for CAP phenotypes, the interactions of cAMP 
      with CAP and the roles played by water structure. A review of mutational analysis 
      of CAP together with the additional structural information presented here 
      suggests a possible mechanism for the cAMP-induced allostery required for DNA 
      binding and transcriptional activation. We hypothesize that cAMP binding may 
      reorient the coiled-coil C-helices, which provide most of the dimer interface, 
      thereby altering the relative positions of the DNA-binding domains of the CAP 
      dimer. Additionally, cAMP binding may cause a further rearrangement of the 
      DNA-binding and cAMP-binding domains of CAP via a flap consisting of beta-strands 
      4 and 5 which lies over the cAMP.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of transport and utilization systems for hexuronides, 
      hexuronates and hexonates in gamma purple bacteria.
PG  - 673-83
AB  - The comparative approach is a powerful tool for the analysis of gene regulation 
      in bacterial genomes. It can be applied to the analysis of regulons that have 
      been studied experimentally as well as that of regulons for which no known 
      regulatory sites are available. It is assumed that the set of co-regulated genes 
      and the regulatory signal itself are conserved in related genomes. Here, we use 
      genomic comparisons to study the regulation of transport and utilization systems 
      for sugar acids in gamma purple bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, 
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia pestis, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Haemophilus 
      influenzae and Vibrio cholerae. The variability of the operon structure and the 
      location of the operator sites for the main transcription factors are 
      demonstrated. The common metabolic map is combined with known and predicted 
      regulatory interactions. It includes all known and predicted members of the GntR, 
      UxuR/ExuR, KdgR, UidR and IdnR regulons. Moreover, most members of these regulons 
      seem to be under catabolite repression mediated by CRP. The candidate UxuR/ExuR 
      signal is proposed, the KdgR consensus is extended, and new operators for all 
      transcription factors are identified in all studied genomes. Two new members of 
      the KdgR regulon, a hypothetical ATP-dependent transport system OgtABCD and YjgK 
      protein with unknown function, are detected. The former is likely to be the 
      transport system for the products of pectin degradation, oligogalacturonides.

TI  - Interdependence of activation at rhaSR by cyclic AMP receptor protein, the RNA 
      polymerase alpha subunit C-terminal domain, and rhaR.
PG  - 6774-82
AB  - The Escherichia coli rhaSR operon encodes two AraC family transcription 
      activators, RhaS and RhaR, and is activated by RhaR in the presence of 
      L-rhamnose. beta-Galactosidase assays of various rhaS-lacZ promoter fusions 
      combined with mobility shift assays indicated that a cyclic AMP receptor protein 
      (CRP) site located at -111.5 is also required for full activation of rhaSR 
      expression. To address the mechanisms of activation by CRP and the RNA polymerase 
      alpha-subunit C-terminal domain (alpha-CTD) at rhaSR, we tested the effects of 
      alanine substitutions in CRP activating regions 1 and 2, overexpression of a 
      truncated version of alpha (alpha-Delta235), and alanine substitutions throughout 
      alpha-CTD. We found that DNA-contacting residues in alpha-CTD are required for 
      full activation, and for simplicity, we discuss alpha-CTD as a third activator of 
      rhaSR. CRP and RhaR could each partially activate transcription in the absence of 
      the other two activators, and alpha-CTD was not capable of activation alone. In 
      the case of CRP, this suggests that this activation involves neither an alpha-CTD 
      interaction nor cooperative binding with RhaR, while in the case of RhaR, this 
      suggests the likelihood of direct interactions with core RNA polymerase. We also 
      found that CRP, RhaR, and alpha-CTD each have synergistic effects on activation 
      by the others, suggesting direct or indirect interactions among all three. We 
      have some evidence that the alpha-CTD-CRP and alpha-CTD-RhaR interactions might 
      be direct. The magnitude of the synergistic effects was usually greater with just 
      two activators than with all three, suggesting possible redundancies in the 
      mechanisms of activation by CRP, alpha-CTD, and RhaR.

TI  - Silencing and activation of ClyA cytotoxin expression in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 6347-57
AB  - Cytolysin A (ClyA) is a pore-forming cytotoxic protein encoded by the clyA gene 
      of Escherichia coli K-12. Genetic analysis suggested that clyA is silenced by the 
      nucleoid protein H-NS. Purified H-NS protein showed preferential binding to clyA 
      sequences in the promoter region, as evidenced by DNase I footprinting and gel 
      mobility shift assays. Transcriptional derepression and activation of a 
      chromosomal clyA::luxAB operon fusion were seen under conditions of H-NS 
      deficiency and SlyA overproduction, respectively. In H-NS-deficient bacteria 
      neither the absence nor the overproduction of SlyA affected the derepressed ClyA 
      expression any further. Therefore, we suggest that overproduction of SlyA in 
      hns(+) E. coli derepresses clyA transcription by counteracting H-NS. The cyclic 
      AMP receptor protein (CRP) was required for ClyA expression, and it interacted 
      with a predicted, albeit suboptimal, CRP binding site in the clyA upstream 
      region. Site-specific alterations of the CRP binding site to match the consensus 
      resulted in substantially higher levels of ClyA expression, while alterations 
      that were predicted to reduce CRP binding reduced ClyA expression. During 
      anaerobic growth the fumarate and nitrate reduction regulator (FNR) was important 
      for ClyA expression, and the clyA gene could be activated by overexpression of 
      FNR. A major clyA transcript having its 5' end (+1) located 72 bp upstream of the 
      translational start codon and 61 bp downstream of the CRP-FNR binding site was 
      detected in the absence of H-NS. The clyA promoter was characterized as a class I 
      promoter that could be transcriptionally activated by CRP and/or FNR. According 
      to DNA bending analyses, the clyA promoter region has high intrinsic curvature. 
      We suggest that it represents a regulatory region which is particularly 
      susceptible to H-NS silencing, and its features are discussed in relation to 
      regulation of other silenced operons.

TI  - Synergistic transcription activation: a dual role for CRP in the activation of an 
      Escherichia coli promoter depending on MalT and CRP.
PG  - 5222-32
AB  - Activation of the Escherichia coli malEp promoter relies on the formation of a 
      higher order structure involving cooperative binding of MalT to promoter-proximal 
      and promoter-distal sites as well as CRP binding to three sites located in 
      between. MalT is the primary activator and one function of CRP is to facilitate 
      cooperative binding of MalT to its cognate sites by bending the intervening DNA. 
      It is shown here that CRP also participates directly in malEp activation. This 
      function is carried out by the molecule of CRP bound to the CRP site centered at 
      -139.5 (CRP site 3). This molecule of CRP recruits RNA polymerase by promoting 
      the binding of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit C-terminal domain (alphaCTD) to 
      DNA immediately downstream from CRP site 3, via a contact between alphaCTD and 
      activating region I of CRP. The action of MalT and CRP at malEp hence provides 
      the example of a novel and complex mechanism for transcriptional synergy in 
      prokaryotes whereby one activator both helps the primary activator to form a 
      productive complex with promoter DNA and interacts directly with RNA polymerase 
      holoenzyme.

TI  - Dual transcriptional regulation of the Escherichia coli 
      phosphate-starvation-inducible psiE gene of the phosphate regulon by PhoB and the 
      cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein complex.
PG  - 5596-9
AB  - We have shown that the Escherichia coli phosphate-starvation-inducible psiE gene 
      is regulated by both phosphate and the carbon source by using both lacZ and 
      chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) fusions. Yet, under all conditions 
      tested, a single transcriptional start site lying 7 bp downstream of a predicted 
      -10 region was revealed by primer extension analysis. DNase I footprinting showed 
      that the PhoB transcriptional-activator protein protects two predicted pho boxes 
      lying upstream of and near the -35 promoter region. Similar analysis showed that 
      the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (cAMP-CRP) complex binds a region 
      that overlaps with the downstream pho box. These results, together with 
      measurements of the in vivo psiE promoter activity under various conditions, show 
      that expression of the psiE gene is under direct positive and negative control by 
      PhoB and cAMP-CRP, respectively.

TI  - Nucleoid proteins stimulate stringently controlled bacterial promoters: a link 
      between the cAMP-CRP and the (p)ppGpp regulons in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 475-85
AB  - We report that the H-NS nucleoid protein plays a positive role in the expression 
      of stringently regulated genes in Escherichia coli. Bacteria lacking both H-NS 
      and the paralog StpA show reduced growth rate. Colonies displaying an increased 
      growth rate were isolated, and mapping of a suppressor mutation revealed a base 
      pair substitution in the spoT gene. The spoT(A404E) mutant showed low ppGpp 
      synthesizing ability. The crp gene, which encodes the global regulator CRP, was 
      subject to negative stringent regulation. The stable RNA/protein ratio in an hns, 
      stpA strain was decreased, whereas it was restored in the suppressor strain. Our 
      findings provide evidence of a direct link between the cAMP-CRP modulon and the 
      stringent response.

TI  - Regulation of expression of the yiaKLMNOPQRS operon for carbohydrate utilization 
      in Escherichia coli: involvement of the main transcriptional factors.
PG  - 4617-24
AB  - The yiaKLMNOPQRS (yiaK-S) gene cluster of Escherichia coli is believed to be 
      involved in the utilization of a hitherto unknown carbohydrate which generates 
      the intermediate L-xylulose. Transcription of yiaK-S as a single message from the 
      unique promoter found upstream of yiaK is proven in this study. The 5' end has 
      been located at 60 bp upstream from the ATG. Expression of the yiaK-S operon is 
      controlled in the wild-type strain by a repressor encoded by yiaJ. No inducer 
      molecule of the yiaK-S operon has been identified among over 80 carbohydrate or 
      derivative compounds tested, the system being expressed only in a mutant strain 
      lacking the YiaJ repressor. The lacZ transcriptional fusions in the genetic 
      background of the mutant strain revealed that yiaK-S is modulated by the 
      integration host factor and by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (Crp) 
      activator complex. A twofold increase in the induction was observed during 
      anaerobic growth, which was independent of ArcA or Fnr. Gel mobility shift assays 
      showed that the YiaJ repressor binds to a promoter fragment extending from -50 to 
      +121. These studies also showed that the cAMP-Crp complex can bind to two 
      different sites. The lacZ transcriptional fusions of different fragments of the 
      promoter demonstrated that binding of cAMP-Crp to the Crp site 1, centered at 
      -106, is essential for yiaK-S expression. The 5' end of the yiaJ gene was 
      determined, and its promoter region was found to overlap with the divergent 
      yiaK-S promoter. Expression of yiaJ is autogenously regulated and reduced by the 
      binding of Crp-cAMP to the Crp site 1 of the yiaK-S promoter.

TI  - Coactivation of the RpoS-dependent proP P2 promoter by fis and cyclic AMP 
      receptor protein.
PG  - 4180-7
AB  - The Escherichia coli proP P2 promoter, which directs the expression of an 
      integral membrane transporter of proline, glycine betaine, and other 
      osmoprotecting compounds, is induced upon entry into stationary phase to protect 
      cells from osmotic shock. Transcription from the P2 promoter is completely 
      dependent on RpoS (sigma(38)) and Fis. Fis activates transcription by binding to 
      a site centered at -41, which overlaps the promoter, where it makes a specific 
      contact with the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase 
      (alpha-CTD). We show here that Fis and cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein 
      (CRP)-cAMP collaborate to activate transcription synergistically in vitro. 
      Coactivation both in vivo and in vitro is dependent on CRP binding to a site 
      centered at -121.5, but CRP without Fis provides little activation. The 
      contribution by CRP requires the correct helical phasing of the CRP site and a 
      functional activation region 1 on CRP. We provide evidence that coactivation is 
      achieved by Fis and CRP independently contacting each of the two alpha-CTDs. 
      Efficient transcription in vitro requires that both activators must be 
      preincubated with the DNA prior to addition of RNA polymerase.

TI  - Regulation of acetyl coenzyme A synthetase in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 4173-9
AB  - Cells of Escherichia coli growing on sugars that result in catabolite repression 
      or amino acids that feed into glycolysis undergo a metabolic switch associated 
      with the production and utilization of acetate. As they divide exponentially, 
      these cells excrete acetate via the phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase pathway. 
      As they begin the transition to stationary phase, they instead resorb acetate, 
      activate it to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by means of the enzyme acetyl-CoA 
      synthetase (Acs) and utilize it to generate energy and biosynthetic components 
      via the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glyoxylate shunt, respectively. Here, we 
      present evidence that this switch occurs primarily through the induction of acs 
      and that the timing and magnitude of this induction depend, in part, on the 
      direct action of the carbon regulator cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) and the 
      oxygen regulator FNR. It also depends, probably indirectly, upon the glyoxylate 
      shunt repressor IclR, its activator FadR, and many enzymes involved in acetate 
      metabolism. On the basis of these results, we propose that cells induce acs, and 
      thus their ability to assimilate acetate, in response to rising cyclic AMP 
      levels, falling oxygen partial pressure, and the flux of carbon through 
      acetate-associated pathways.

TI  - Regulation of the divergent guaBA and xseA promoters of Escherichia coli by the 
      cyclic AMP receptor protein.
PG  - 115-22
AB  - The gua promoter (guaP) of Escherichia coli resembles those for ribosomal RNA 
      (rrn) operons and lies in a close back-to-back arrangement with the promoter for 
      xseA (xseP). Transcription from guaP is subject to stringent control and 
      growth-rate-dependent regulation, and to repression by DnaA and PurR. In 
      addition, transcription from guaP is regulated by the cyclic AMP receptor protein 
      (CRP). Plasmid-borne promoter fusions to the receptor gene for chloramphenicol 
      acetyl transferase were used to assess the role of CRP in controlling 
      transcription from guaP and xseP following a downshift of cultures from rich into 
      minimal medium. CRP is required to activate guaBA transcription and repress xseA 
      transcription following downshift. Bandshift assays with a DNA fragment carrying 
      the divergent promoters revealed specific binding of CRP. We propose that CRP, 
      binding to a near-consensus site centred at -117.5, activates transcription from 
      guaP and obstructs transcription from the xseA promoter.

TI  - Roles of cyclic AMP receptor protein and the carboxyl-terminal domain of the 
      alpha subunit in transcription activation of the Escherichia coli rhaBAD operon.
PG  - 3529-35
AB  - The Escherichia coli rhaBAD operon encodes the enzymes for catabolism of the 
      sugar L-rhamnose. Full rhaBAD activation requires the AraC family activator RhaS 
      (bound to a site that overlaps the -35 region of the promoter) and the cyclic AMP 
      receptor protein (CRP; bound immediately upstream of RhaS at -92.5). We tested 
      alanine substitutions in activating regions (AR) 1 and 2 of CRP for their effect 
      on rhaBAD activation. Some, but not all, of the substitutions in both AR1 and AR2 
      resulted in approximately twofold defects in expression from rhaBAD promoter 
      fusions. We also expressed a derivative of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase 
      deleted for the entire C-terminal domain (alpha-Delta235) and assayed expression 
      from rhaBAD promoter fusions. The greatest defect (54-fold) occurred at a 
      truncated promoter where RhaS was the only activator, while the defect at the 
      full-length promoter (RhaS plus CRP) was smaller (13-fold). Analysis of a plasmid 
      library expressing alanine substitutions at every residue in the 
      carboxyl-terminal domain of the alpha subunit (alpha-CTD) identified 15 residues 
      (mostly in the DNA-binding determinant) that were important at both the 
      full-length and truncated promoters. Only one substitution was defective at the 
      full-length but not the truncated promoter, and this residue was located in the 
      DNA-binding determinant. Six substitutions were defective only at the promoter 
      activated by RhaS alone, and these may define a protein-contacting determinant on 
      alpha-CTD. Overall, our results suggest that CRP interaction with alpha-CTD may 
      not be required for rhaBAD activation; however, alpha-CTD does contribute to full 
      activation, probably through interactions with DNA and possibly RhaS.

TI  - Mechanism of catabolite repression in the bgl operon of Escherichia coli: 
      involvement of the anti-terminator BglG, CRP-cAMP and EIIAGlc in mediating 
      glucose effect downstream of transcription initiation.
PG  - 239-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expression of the bgl operon of Escherichia coli, involved in the 
      regulated uptake and utilization of aromatic beta-glucosides, is extremely 
      sensitive to the presence of glucose in the growth medium. We have analysed the 
      mechanism by which glucose exerts its inhibitory effect on bgl expression. 
      RESULTS: Our studies show that initiation of transcription from the bgl promoter 
      is only marginally sensitive to glucose. Instead, glucose exerts a more 
      significant inhibition on the elongation of transcription beyond the 
      rho-independent terminator present within the leader sequence. Transcriptional 
      analyses using plasmids that carry mutations in bglG or within the terminator, 
      suggest that the target for glucose-mediated repression is the anti-terminator 
      protein, BglG. Introduction of multiple copies of bglG or the presence of 
      mutations that inhibit its phosphorylation by Enzyme IIBgl (BglF), result in loss 
      of glucose repression. Studies using crp, cya and crr strains show that both 
      CRP-cAMP and the Enzyme IIAGlc (EIIAGlc) are involved in the regulation. Although 
      transcription initiation is normal in a crp, cya double mutant, no detectable 
      transcription is seen downstream of the terminator, which is restored by a 
      mutation within the terminator. Transcription past the terminator is also partly 
      restored by the addition of exogenous cAMP to glucose-grown cultures of a crp+ 
      strain. Glucose repression is lost in the crr mutant strain. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results summarized above indicate that glucose repression in the bgl operon is 
      mediated at the level of transcription anti-termination, and glucose affects the 
      activity of BglG by altering its phosphorylation by BglF. The CRP-cAMP complex is 
      also involved in this regulation. The results using the crr mutant suggest a 
      negative role for EIIAGlc in the catabolite repression of the bgl genes.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the divergent paa catabolic operons for 
      phenylacetic acid degradation in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 12214-22
AB  - The expression of the divergently transcribed paaZ and paaABCDEFGHIJK catabolic 
      operons, which are responsible for phenylacetic acid (PA) degradation in 
      Escherichia coli, is driven by the Pz and Pa promoters, respectively. To study 
      the transcriptional regulation of the inducible paa catabolic genes, genetic and 
      biochemical approaches were used. Gel retardation assays showing that the PaaX 
      regulator binds specifically to the Pa and Pz promoters were complemented with in 
      vivo experiments that indicated a PaaX-mediated repression effect on the 
      expression of Pa-lacZ and Pz-lacZ reporter fusions. The region within the Pa and 
      Pz promoters that is protected by the PaaX repressor in DNase I footprinting 
      assays contains a conserved 15-base pair imperfect palindromic sequence motif 
      that was shown, through mutational analysis, to be indispensable for PaaX binding 
      and repression. PA-coenzyme A (PA-CoA), but not PA, specifically inhibited 
      binding of PaaX to the target sequences, thus confirming the first intermediate 
      of the pathway as the true inducer and PaaX as the only bacterial regulatory 
      protein described so far that responds to an aryl-CoA compound. Superimposed in 
      the specific PaaX-mediated regulation is transcriptional activation by the cAMP 
      receptor protein and the integration host factor protein. These global regulators 
      may adjust the transcriptional output from Pa and Pz promoters to the overall 
      growth status of the cell.

TI  - Reiterative transcription initiation from galP2 promoter of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 185-95
AB  - The expression of gal operon in Escherichia coli is driven by two promoters, P1 
      and P2 separated by 5 bp. The transcription initiated from the P2 generates a 
      large amount of abortive transcripts to produce a comparable amount of 
      full-length transcript as P1 in vitro. In this study, we investigated the source 
      of the abortive transcripts by employing a quantitative potassium permanganate 
      footprinting method that determines the extent of open promoter complex 
      formation. The extents of open promoter complex formation at the two gal 
      promoters were about the same during the given reaction time while the amount of 
      transcription initiation determined by in vitro transcription assay showed a 
      considerable difference: several hundred-fold more transcription initiation from 
      the P2 than the P1, most of which was abortive. Thus, it was concluded that the 
      abortive transcripts are generated reiteratively by a small fraction of RNA 
      polymerase. An in vitro transcription assay using an immobilized DNA template 
      revealed that the fraction of RNA polymerase generating abortive transcripts 
      never produces the full-length transcript and it remains bound to the promoter. 
      We concluded that there are two kinds of RNA polymerase-promoter complexes formed 
      at galP2, at least in vitro, productive complex and nonproductive complex; and, 
      the nonproductive complex is responsible for generating large amount of abortive 
      transcripts from the P2.

TI  - Repression of the Escherichia coli melR promoter by MelR: evidence that efficient 
      repression requires the formation of a repression loop.
PG  - 223-9
AB  - The Escherichia coli MelR protein is a transcription activator that, in the 
      presence of melibiose, activates expression of the melAB operon by binding to 
      four sites located just upstream of the melAB promoter. MelR is encoded by the 
      melR gene, which is expressed from a divergent transcript that starts 237 bp 
      upstream of the melAB promoter transcript start point. In a recent study, we have 
      identified a fifth DNA site for MelR that overlaps the melR promoter transcript 
      start and -10 region. Here we show that MelR binding to this site can 
      downregulate expression from the melR promoter; thus, MelR autoregulates its own 
      expression. Optimal repression of the melR promoter is observed in the absence of 
      melibiose and requires one of the four other DNA sites for MelR at the melAB 
      promoter. The two MelR binding sites required for this optimal repression are 
      separated by 177 bp. We suggest that, in the absence of melibiose, MelR forms a 
      loop between these two sites. We argue that, in the presence of melibiose, this 
      loop is broken as the melAB promoter is activated. However, in the presence of 
      melibiose, the melR promoter can still be partially repressed by MelR binding to 
      the site that overlaps the transcript start and -10 region. Parallels with the 
      Escherichia coli araC-araBAD regulatory region are discussed.

TI  - Transcription activation at the Escherichia coli melAB promoter: the role of MelR 
      and the cyclic AMP receptor protein.
PG  - 211-22
AB  - MelR is a melibiose-triggered transcription activator that belongs to the AraC 
      family of transcription factors. Using purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase 
      and a cloned DNA fragment carrying the entire melibiose operon intergenic region, 
      we have demonstrated in vitro open complex formation and activation of 
      transcription initiation at the melAB promoter. This activation is dependent on 
      MelR and melibiose. These studies also show that the cyclic AMP receptor protein 
      (CRP) interacts with the melAB promoter and increases MelR-dependent 
      transcription activation. DNAase I footprinting has been exploited to investigate 
      the location of MelR-and CRP-binding sites at the melAB promoter. We showed 
      previously that MelR binds to two identical 18 bp target sequences centred at 
      position -100.5 (Site 1) and position -62.5 (Site 2). In this work, we show that 
      MelR additionally binds to two other related 18 bp sequences: Site 1', centred at 
      position -120.5, located immediately upstream of Site 1, and Site R, at position 
      -238.5, which overlaps the transcription start site of the divergent melR 
      promoter. MelR can bind to Site 1', Site 1, Site 2 and Site R, in both the 
      absence and the presence of melibiose. However, in the presence of melibiose, 
      MelR also binds to a fifth site (Site 2', centred at position -42.5) located 
      immediately downstream of Site 2, and overlapping the -35 region of the melAB 
      promoter. Additionally, although CRP is unable to bind to the melAB promoter in 
      the absence of MelR, in the presence of MelR, it binds to a site located between 
      MelR binding Site 1 and Site 2. Thus, tandem-bound MelR recruits CRP to the MelR. 
      We propose that expression from the melAB promoter has an absolute requirement 
      for MelR binding to Site 2'. Optimal expression of the melAB promoter requires 
      Sites 1', Site 1, Site 2 and Site 2'; CRP acts as a 'bridge' between MelR bound 
      at Sites 1' and 1 and at Sites 2 and 2', increasing expression from the melAB 
      promoter. In support of this model, we show that improvement of the base sequence 
      of Site 2' removes the requirement for Site 1' and Site 1, and short circuits the 
      effects of CRP.

TI  - Cooperative action of the catabolite activator protein and AraC in vitro at the 
      araFGH promoter.
PG  - 1995-2000
AB  - Full activation of transcription of the araFGH promoter, p(FGH), requires both 
      the catabolite activator protein (CAP) and AraC protein. At p(FGH), the binding 
      site for CAP is centered at position -41.5, an essential binding site for AraC is 
      centered at position -79.5, and a second, nonessential binding site is centered 
      at position -154.5. In this work, we used the minimal promoter region required 
      for in vivo activation of p(FGH) to examine the roles of CAP and AraC in 
      stimulating formation of open complexes at p(FGH). Migration retardation assays 
      of open complexes showed that RNA polymerase binds exceptionally tightly to the 
      AraC-CAP-p(FGH) complex and that the order of addition of proteins to the 
      initiating complex is important. Similar assays with RNA polymerase containing 
      truncated alpha subunits suggest that AraC interacts with the C-terminal domain 
      of the alpha subunit. Finally, AraC protein also acts to prevent the improper 
      binding of RNA polymerase at a pseudo promoter near the true p(FGH) promoter.

TI  - Multiple control of flagellum biosynthesis in Escherichia coli: role of H-NS 
      protein and the cyclic AMP-catabolite activator protein complex in transcription 
      of the flhDC master operon.
PG  - 7500-8
AB  - Little is known about the molecular mechanism by which histone-like 
      nucleoid-structuring (H-NS) protein and cyclic AMP-catabolite activator protein 
      (CAP) complex control bacterial motility. In the present paper, we show that crp 
      and hns mutants are nonmotile due to a complete lack of flagellin accumulation. 
      This results from a reduced expression in vivo of fliA and fliC, which encode the 
      specific flagellar sigma factor and flagellin, respectively. Overexpression of 
      the flhDC master operon restored, at least in part, motility in crp and hns 
      mutant strains, suggesting that this operon is the main target for both 
      regulators. Binding of H-NS and CAP to the regulatory region of the master operon 
      was demonstrated by gel retardation experiments, and their DNA binding sites were 
      identified by DNase I footprinting assays. In vitro transcription experiments 
      showed that CAP activates flhDC expression while H-NS represses it. In agreement 
      with this observation, the activity of a transcriptional fusion carrying the 
      flhDC promoter was decreased in the crp strain and increased in the hns mutant. 
      In contrast, the activity of a transcriptional fusion encompassing the entire 
      flhDC regulatory region extending to the ATG translational start codon was 
      strongly reduced in both hns and crp mutants. These results suggest that the 
      region downstream of the +1 transcriptional start site plays a crucial role in 
      the positive control by H-NS of flagellum biosynthesis in vivo. Finally, the lack 
      of complementation of the nonmotile phenotype in a crp mutant by 
      activation-deficient CAP mutated proteins and characterization of cfs, a mutation 
      resulting in a CAP-independent motility behavior, demonstrate that CAP activates 
      flhDC transcription by binding to its promoter and interacting with RNA 
      polymerase.

TI  - A cyclic AMP receptor protein mutant that constitutively activates an Escherichia

PG  - 7457-63
AB  - Previously an Escherichia coli mutant that had acquired the ability to grow on 
      propanediol as the sole carbon and energy source was isolated. This phenotype is 
      the result of the constitutive expression of the fucO gene (in the fucAO operon), 
      which encodes one of the enzymes in the fucose metabolic pathway. The mutant was 
      found to bear an IS5 insertion in the intergenic regulatory region between the 
      divergently oriented fucAO and fucPIK operons. Though expression of the fucAO 
      operon was constitutive, the fucPIK operon became noninducible such that the 
      mutant could no longer grow on fucose. A fucose-positive revertant which was 
      found to contain a suppressor mutation in the crp gene was selected. Here we 
      identify this crp mutation, which results in a single amino acid substitution 
      (K52N) that has been proposed previously to uncover a cryptic activating region 
      in the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP). We show that the mutant CRP 
      constitutively activates transcription from both the IS5-disrupted and the 
      wild-type fucPIK promoters, and we identify the CRP-binding site that is required 
      for this activity. Our results show that the fucPIK promoter, a complex promoter 
      which ordinarily depends on both CRP and the fucose-specific regulator FucR for 
      its activation, can be activated in the absence of FucR by a mutant CRP that uses 
      three, rather than two, activating regions to contact RNA polymerase. For the 
      IS5-disrupted promoter, which retains a single CRP-binding site, the additional 
      activating region of the mutant CRP evidently compensates for the lack of 
      upstream regulatory sequences.

TI  - The cAMP receptor protein CRP can function as an osmoregulator of transcription 
      in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 3081-91
AB  - Transcription of the P1 promoter of the Escherichia coli proP gene, which encodes 
      a transporter of osmoprotectants, is strongly induced by a shift to hyperosmotic 
      media. Unlike most other osmotically regulated promoters, the induction occurs 
      for a brief period of time, corresponding to the replacement of intracellular 
      K(+) glutamate with osmoprotecting compounds. This burst of proP transcription is 
      correlated with the osmolarity-dependent binding of the cAMP receptor protein CRP 
      to a site within the proP P1 promoter. We show that CRP-cAMP functions as an 
      osmotically sensitive repressor of proP P1 transcription in vitro. Binding of CRP 
      to the proP promoter in vivo is transiently destabilized after a hyperosmotic 
      shift with kinetics that correspond to the derepression of transcription, whereas 
      Fis and Lac repressor binding is not osmotically sensitive. Similar osmotic 
      regulation of proP P1 transcription by the CRP* mutant implies that binding of 
      cAMP is not responsible for the unusual osmotic sensitivity of CRP activity. 
      Osmotic regulation of CRP activity is not limited to proP. Activation of the lac 
      promoter by CRP is also transiently inhibited after an osmotic upshift, as is the 
      binding of CRP to the galdelta4P1 promoter. These findings suggest that CRP 
      functions in certain contexts to regulate gene expression in response to osmotic 
      changes, in addition to its role in catabolite control.

TI  - RNA polymerase alpha and sigma(70) subunits participate in transcription of the 
      Escherichia coli uhpT promoter.
PG  - 7266-73
AB  - Fundamental questions in bacterial gene regulation concern how multiple 
      regulatory proteins interact with the transcription apparatus at a single 
      promoter and what are the roles of protein contacts with RNA polymerase and 
      changes in DNA conformation. Transcription of the Escherichia coli uhpT gene, 
      encoding the inducible sugar phosphate transporter, is dependent on the response 
      regulator UhpA and is stimulated by the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CAP). UhpA 
      binds to multiple sites in the uhpT promoter between positions -80 and -32 
      upstream of the transcription start site, and CAP binds to a single site centered 
      at position -103.5. The role in uhpT transcription of portions of RNA polymerase 
      Esigma(70) holoenzyme which affect regulation at other promoters was examined by 
      using series of alanine substitutions throughout the C-terminal domains of RpoA 
      (residues 255 to 329) and of RpoD (residues 570 to 613). Alanine substitutions 
      that affected in vivo expression of a uhpT-lacZ transcriptional fusion were 
      tested for their effect on in vitro transcription activity by using reconstituted 
      holoenzymes. Consistent with the binding of UhpA near the -35 region, residues 
      K593 and K599 in the C-terminal region of RpoD were necessary for efficient uhpT 
      expression in response to UhpA alone. Their requirement was overcome when CAP was 
      also present. In addition, residues R265, G296, and S299 in the DNA-binding 
      surface of the C-terminal domain of RpoA (alphaCTD) were important for uhpT 
      transcription even in the presence of CAP. Substitutions at several other 
      positions had effects in cells but not during in vitro transcription with 
      saturating levels of the transcription factors. Two DNase-hypersensitive sites 
      near the upstream end of the UhpA-binding region were seen in the presence of all 
      three transcription factors. Their appearance required functional alphaCTD but 
      not the presence of upstream DNA. These results suggest that both transcription 
      activators depend on or interact with different subunits of RNA polymerase, 
      although their role in formation of proper DNA geometry may also be crucial.

TI  - Positive co-regulation of the Escherichia coli carnitine pathway cai and fix 
      operons by CRP and the CaiF activator.
PG  - 562-75
AB  - Activation of the two divergent Escherichia coli cai and fix operons involved in 
      anaerobic carnitine metabolism is co-dependent on the cyclic AMP receptor protein 
      (CRP) and on CaiF, the specific carnitine-sensitive transcriptional regulator. 
      CaiF was overproduced using a phage T7 system, purified on a heparin column and 
      ran as a 15 kDa protein on SDS-PAGE. DNase I footprinting and interference 
      experiments identified two sites, F1 and F2, with apparently comparable 
      affinities for the binding of CaiF in the cai-fix regulatory region. These sites 
      share a common perfect inverted repeat comprising two 11 bp half-sites separated 
      by 13 bp, and centred at -70 and -127 from the fix transcription start site. They 
      were found to overlap the two low-affinity binding sites, CRP2 and CRP3, 
      determined previously for CRP. Gel shift assays and footprinting experiments 
      suggest that CaiF and CRP bind co-operatively to the F1/CRP2 and F2/CRP3 sites of 
      the intergenic cai-fix region. Moreover, they appeared to serve the simultaneous 
      binding of each other, giving rise to an original multiprotein CRP-CaiF complex 
      enabling RNA polymerase recruitment and local DNA untwisting, at least at the fix 
      promoter. Using random mutagenesis, two CaiF mutants impaired in transcription 
      activation were isolated. The N-terminal A27V mutation affected the structural 
      organization of the activator, whereas the central I62N mutation was suggested to 
      interfere with DNA binding.

TI  - Transcription activation by catabolite activator protein (CAP).
PG  - 199-213
AB  - Transcription activation by Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein (CAP) 
      at each of two classes of simple CAP-dependent promoters is understood in 
      structural and mechanistic detail. At class I CAP-dependent promoters, CAP 
      activates transcription from a DNA site located upstream of the DNA site for RNA 
      polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP); at these promoters, transcription activation 
      involves protein-protein interactions between CAP and the RNAP alpha subunit 
      C-terminal domain that facilitate binding of RNAP to promoter DNA to form the 
      RNAP-promoter closed complex. At class II CAP-dependent promoters, CAP activates 
      transcription from a DNA site that overlaps the DNA site for RNAP; at these 
      promoters, transcription activation involves both: (i) protein-protein 
      interactions between CAP and RNAP alpha subunit C-terminal domain that facilitate 
      binding of RNAP to promoter DNA to form the RNAP-promoter closed complex; and 
      (ii) protein-protein interactions between CAP and RNAP alpha subunit N-terminal 
      domain that facilitates isomerization of the RNAP-promoter closed complex to the 
      RNAP-promoter open complex. Straightforward combination of the mechanisms for 
      transcription activation at class I and class II CAP-dependent promoters permits 
      synergistic transcription activation by multiple molecules of CAP, or by CAP and 
      other activators. Interference with determinants of CAP or RNAP involved in 
      transcription activation at class I and class II CAP-dependent promoters permits 
      "anti-activation" by negative regulators. Basic features of transcription 
      activation at class I and class II CAP-dependent promoters appear to be 
      generalizable to other activators.

TI  - Separate contributions of UhpA and CAP to activation of transcription of the uhpT 
      promoter of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 973-86
AB  - Activation of promoters by multiple transcription factors might occur through 
      favorable contacts of the activators with themselves or RNA polymerase, or by 
      changes in DNA geometry that enhance formation of the transcription complex. 
      Transcription of the Escherichia coli uhpT gene, encoding the organophosphate 
      transporter, requires the response regulator UhpA and is stimulated by the global 
      regulator protein CAP. CAP binds to the uhpT promoter at a single site, centered 
      at -103.5 bp relative to the start of transcription, and UhpA binds to multiple 
      sites between positions -80 and -32. Overexpression of UhpA did not reduce the 
      degree of CAP stimulation of uhpT-lacZ expression, showing that CAP action is 
      more complex than enhancement of the binding of UhpA. Footprinting experiments 
      demonstrated that UhpA and CAP modestly stimulated each other's binding to the 
      uhpT promoter, but did not affect the positioning of the binding sites. An in 
      vitro transcription system was used to examine the contribution of each 
      transcription factor at the uhpT promoter. Action of UhpA and CAP proteins was 
      not affected by template supercoiling. Kinetic analyses of productive and 
      abortive initiation showed that CAP acted both to stabilize by fivefold the open 
      promoter complexes formed in the presence of UhpA and to enhance by twofold the 
      rate of their formation. These results indicate that open complex formation 
      requires UhpA and that CAP stabilizes the open complex.

TI  - Inactivation and regulation of the aerobic C(4)-dicarboxylate transport (dctA) 
      gene of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5624-35
AB  - The gene (dctA) encoding the aerobic C(4)-dicarboxylate transporter (DctA) of 
      Escherichia coli was previously mapped to the 79-min region of the linkage map. 
      The nucleotide sequence of this region reveals two candidates for the dctA gene: 
      f428 at 79.3 min and the o157a-o424-o328 (or orfQMP) operon at 79.9 min. The f428 
      gene encodes a homologue of the Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium 
      leguminosarum H(+)/C(4)-dicarboxylate symporter, DctA, whereas the orfQMP operon 
      encodes homologues of the aerobic periplasmic-binding protein- dependent 
      C(4)-dicarboxylate transport system (DctQ, DctM, and DctP) of Rhodobacter 
      capsulatus. To determine which, if either, of these loci specify the E. coli DctA 
      system, the chromosomal f428 and orfM genes were inactivated by inserting Sp(r) 
      or Ap(r) cassettes, respectively. The resulting f428 mutant was unable to grow 
      aerobically with fumarate or malate as the sole carbon source and grew poorly 
      with succinate. Furthermore, fumarate uptake was abolished in the f428 mutant and 
      succinate transport was approximately 10-fold lower than that of the wild type. 
      The growth and fumarate transport deficiencies of the f428 mutant were 
      complemented by transformation with an f428-containing plasmid. No growth defect 
      was found for the orfM mutant. In combination, the above findings confirm that 
      f428 corresponds to the dctA gene and indicate that the orfQMP products play no 
      role in C(4)-dicarboxylate transport. Regulation studies with a dctA-lacZ 
      (f428-lacZ) transcriptional fusion showed that dctA is subject to cyclic AMP 
      receptor protein (CRP)-dependent catabolite repression and ArcA-mediated 
      anaerobic repression and is weakly induced by the DcuS-DcuR system in response to 
      C(4)-dicarboxylates and citrate. Interestingly, in a dctA mutant, expression of 
      dctA is constitutive with respect to C(4)-dicarboxylate induction, suggesting 
      that DctA regulates its own synthesis. Northern blot analysis revealed a single, 
      monocistronic dctA transcript and confirmed that dctA is subject to regulation by 
      catabolite repression and CRP. Reverse transcriptase-mediated primer extension 
      indicated a single transcriptional start site centered 81 bp downstream of a 
      strongly predicted CRP-binding site.

TI  - Negative regulation of the pts operon by Mlc: mechanism underlying glucose 
      induction in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 391-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pts operon of Escherichia coli consists of three genes ptsH, ptsI 
      and crr, each encoding for central components of the phosphoenolpyruvate: 
      carbohydrate phosphotransferase system, HPr, enzyme I and IIAGlc, respectively. 
      Transcription of the pts operon is stimulated when glucose is present in the 
      culture medium. One of the two major promoters, P0, is responsible for this 
      glucose induction. However, no regulatory protein responsible for the glucose 
      induction of the pts operon has been identified yet and molecular mechanism by 
      which glucose stimulates the pts transcription is not known. RESULTS: We found by 
      Northern blotting that the pts mRNA levels in cells lacking Mlc, a new global 
      repressor of carbohydrate metabolism, were increased without external glucose and 
      that the addition of glucose had no effect on the pts mRNA levels in the mutant 
      cells. Western blotting revealed that the enzyme I level in the mlc- cells was 
      also elevated without glucose and no further increase in the enzyme I level was 
      observed in the presence of glucose. S1 analysis revealed that transcription of 
      the glucose-sensitive promoter, P0, occurs constitutively in the mlc- cells 
      independently from the external glucose. In vitro transcription studies indicated 
      that Mlc strongly inhibited P0 transcription. DNase I footprinting experiment 
      revealed that Mlc bound to P0 promoter region to prevent RNA polymerase binding 
      at P0. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Mlc is a repressor for the pts transcription 
      acting as a major regulatory protein involved in the glucose induction of pts 
      operon. We propose that glucose induces the pts transcription by modulating the 
      Mlc activity. The mechanism by which glucose modulates the Mlc action remains to 
      be studied.

TI  - Purification of Mlc and analysis of its effects on the pts expression in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 25398-402
AB  - Products of the pts operon of Escherichia coli have multiple physiological roles 
      such as sugar transport, and the operon is controlled by two promoters, P0 and 
      P1. Expression of the pts P0 promoter that is increased during growth in the 
      presence of glucose is also activated by cAMP receptor protein.cAMP. Based on the 
      existence of a sequence that has a high similarity with the known Mlc binding 
      site in the promoter, the effects of the Mlc protein on the pts P0 promoter 
      expression were studied. In vivo transcription assays using wild type and 
      mlc-negative E. coli strains grown in the presence and absence of glucose 
      indicate that Mlc negatively regulates expression of the P0 promoter, and 
      Mlc-dependent repression is relieved by glucose in the growth medium. In vitro 
      transcription assay using purified recombinant Mlc showed that Mlc repressed 
      transcription from the P0 but did not affect the activity of the P1. DNase I 
      footprinting experiments revealed that a Mlc binding site was located around +1 
      to +25 of the promoter and that Mlc inhibited the binding of RNA polymerase to 
      the P0 promoter. Cells overexpressing Mlc showed a very slow fermentation rate 
      compared with the wild type when grown in the presence of various 
      phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferase system sugars but few 
      differences in the presence of non-phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate 
      phosphotransferase system sugars except maltose. These results suggest that the 
      pts operon is one of major targets for the negative regulation by Mlc, and thus 
      Mlc regulates the utilization of various sugars as well as glucose in E. coli. 
      The possibility that the inducer of Mlc may not be sugar or its derivative but an 
      unknown factor is proposed to explain the Mlc induction mechanism by various 
      sugars.

TI  - Role of multiple CytR binding sites on cooperativity, competition, and induction 
      at the Escherichia coli udp promoter.
PG  - 16010-9
AB  - The CytR repressor fulfills dual roles as both a repressor of transcription from 
      promoters of the Escherichia coli CytR regulon and a co-activator in some 
      circumstances. Transcription is repressed by a three-protein complex (cAMP 
      receptor protein (CRP)-CytR-CRP) that is stabilized by cooperative interactions 
      between CRP and CytR. However, cooperativity also means that CytR can recruit CRP 
      and, by doing so, can act as a co-activator. The central role of cooperativity in 
      regulation is highlighted by the fact that binding of the inducer, cytidine, to 
      CytR is coupled to CytR-CRP cooperativity; this underlies the mechanism for 
      induction. Similar interactions at the different promoters of the CytR regulon 
      coordinate expression of the transport proteins and enzymes required for 
      nucleoside catabolism but also provide differential expression of these genes. A 
      fundamental question in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene regulation is how 
      combinatorial mechanisms of this sort regulate differential expression. Recently, 
      we showed that CytR binds specifically to multiple sites in the E. coli deoP 
      promoter, thereby providing competition for CRP binding to CRP operator site 1 
      (CRP1) and CRP2 as well as cooperativity. The effect of the competition at this 
      promoter is to negate the role of CytR in recruiting CRP. Here, we have used 
      quantitative footprint and mobility shift analysis to investigate CRP and CytR 
      binding to the E. coli udp promoter. Here too, we find that CytR both cooperates 
      and competes for CRP binding. However, consistent with both the distribution of 
      CytR recognition motifs in the sequence of the promoter and the regulation of the 
      promoter, the competition is limited to CRP2. When cytidine binds to CytR, the 
      effect on cooperativity is very different at the udp promoter than at the deoP2 
      promoter. Cooperativity with CRP at CRP1 is nearly eliminated, but the effect on 
      CytR-CRP2 cooperativity is negligible. These results are discussed in relation to 
      the current structural model of CytR in which the core, inducer-binding domain is 
      tethered to the helix-turn-helix, DNA-binding domain via flexible peptide 
      linkers.

TI  - Lrp binds to two regions in the dadAX promoter region of Escherichia coli to 
      repress and activate transcription directly.
PG  - 29-40
AB  - The dadAX operon is expressed by multiple promoters that are repressed by 
      leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) and activated by cyclic AMP-CRP. In 
      previous work, we found that alanine or leucine acted as inducers to antagonize 
      Lrp repression of the three major promoters directly. Here, we identify 11 Lrp 
      binding sites located within 350 bp of dad DNA. A mutational analysis, coupled 
      with in vivo and in vitro transcription experiments, indicated that Lrp sites 
      that overlap the dad promoters were involved in repression. In contrast, sites 
      upstream of the promoters did not appear to be necessary for repression, but were 
      required for activation by Lrp plus alanine or leucine of one of the major dad 
      promoters, P2. This activation by alanine or leucine was not simply relief of 
      repression, as P2 transcription from a constitutive template was increased 
      fivefold compared with the basal level of transcription found in the absence of 
      Lrp and the co-activator cyclic AMP-CRP. Alanine or leucine decreased the 
      affinity of Lrp to repressor sites, while having little or no effect on the 
      binding of Lrp to activator sites. This differential effect of alanine and 
      leucine on Lrp binding helps to explain how these modifiers influence both 
      repression and activation of the dad operon.

TI  - The cyclic AMP receptor protein is dependent on GcvA for regulation of the gcv 
      operon.
PG  - 1912-9
AB  - The Escherichia coli gcv operon is transcriptionally regulated by the GcvA, GcvR, 
      Lrp, and PurR proteins. In this study, the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein 
      (CRP) is shown to be involved in positive regulation of the gcv operon. A crp 
      deletion reduced expression of a gcvT-lacZ fusion almost fourfold in glucose 
      minimal (GM) medium. The phenotype was complemented by both the wild-type crp 
      gene and four crp alleles that encode proteins with amino acid substitutions in 
      known activating regions of CRP. A cyaA deletion also resulted in a fourfold 
      decrease in gcvT-lacZ expression, and wild-type expression was restored by the 
      addition of cAMP to the growth medium. A cyaA crp double deletion resulted in 
      levels of gcvT-lacZ expression identical to those observed with either single 
      mutation, showing that CRP and cAMP regulate through the same mechanism. Growth 
      in GM medium plus cAMP or glycerol minimal medium did not result in a significant 
      increase in gcvT-lacZ expression. Thus, the level of cAMP present in GM medium 
      appears to be sufficient for regulation by CRP. DNase I footprint analysis showed 
      that CRP binds and protects two sites centered at bp -313 (site 1) and bp -140 
      (site 2) relative to the transcription initiation site, but a mutational analysis 
      demonstrated that only site 1 is required for CRP-mediated regulation of 
      gcvT-lacZ expression. Expression of the gcvT-lacZ fusion in a crp gcvA double 
      mutant suggested that CRP's role is dependent on the GcvA protein.

TI  - Catabolic repression of secB expression is positively controlled by cyclic AMP 
      (cAMP) receptor protein-cAMP complexes at the transcriptional level.
PG  - 1892-9
AB  - SecB, a protein export-specific chaperone, enhances the export of a subset of 
      proteins across cytoplasmic membranes of Escherichia coli. Previous studies 
      showed that the synthesis of SecB is repressed by the presence of glucose in the 
      medium. The derepression of SecB requires the products of both the cya and crp 
      genes, indicating that secB expression is under the control of catabolic 
      repression. In this study, two secB-specific promoters were identified. In 
      addition, 5' transcription initiation sites from these two promoters were 
      determined by means of secB-lacZ fusions and primer extension. The distal P1 
      promoter appeared to be independent of carbon sources, whereas the proximal P2 
      promoter was shown to be subject to control by the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor 
      protein (CRP)-cAMP complexes. Gel-mobility shift studies showed that this 
      regulation results from direct interaction between the secB P2 promoter region 
      and the CRP-cAMP complex. Moreover, the CRP binding site on the secB gene was 
      determined by DNase I footprinting and further substantiated by mutational 
      analysis. The identified secB CRP binding region is centered at the -61.5 region 
      of the secB gene and differed from the putative binding sites predicted by 
      computer analysis.

TI  - The gluconate high affinity transport of GntI in Escherichia coli involves a 
      multicomponent complex system.
PG  - 395-404
AB  - Within the main system for gluconate utilization in E. coli, the gntT gene 
      (located at the minute 76.4) that encodes a permease, is currently the only 
      element involved in the high affinity transport. In this paper, the nucleotide 
      sequence of the upstream region of this locus was determined. Two open reading 
      frames of 729 bp (gntX) and 573 bp (gntY) were identified as additional gnt genes 
      by complementation studies. Our observations suggest that these loci might 
      conform an operon distinct of gntT under the control of the gntR gene product. 
      Such operon encodes a gluconate periplasmic binding protein (GntX) and a putative 
      membrane-bound protein (GntY). These products and the permease encoded by the 
      gntT gene seem to conform a high-affinity complex transport system for gluconate. 
      We suggest that this novel system could belong to the TRAP transporters.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation and organization of the dcuA and dcuB genes, encoding 
      homologous anaerobic C4-dicarboxylate transporters in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 6586-96
AB  - The dcuA and dcuB genes of Escherichia coli encode homologous proteins that 
      appear to function as independent and mutually redundant C4-dicarboxylate 
      transporters during anaerobiosis. The dcuA gene is 117 bp downstream of, and has 
      the same polarity as, the aspartase gene (aspA), while dcuB is 77 bp upstream of, 
      and has the same polarity as, the anaerobic fumarase gene (fumB). To learn more 
      about the respective roles of the dcu genes, the environmental and regulatory 
      factors influencing their expression were investigated by generating and 
      analyzing single-copy dcuA- and dcuB-lacZ transcriptional fusions. The results 
      show that dcuA is constitutively expressed whereas dcuB expression is highly 
      regulated. The dcuB gene is strongly activated anaerobically by FNR, repressed in 
      the presence of nitrate by NarL, and subject to cyclic AMP receptor protein 
      (CRP)-mediated catabolite repression. In addition, dcuB is strongly induced by 
      C4-dicarboxylates, suggesting that dcuB is under the control of an 
      uncharacterized C4-dicarboxylate-responsive gene regulator. Northern blotting 
      confirmed that dcuA (and aspA) is expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic 
      conditions and that dcuB (and fumB) is induced anaerobically. Major monocistronic 
      transcripts were identified for aspA and dcuA, as well as a minor species 
      possibly corresponding to an aspA-dcuA cotranscript. Five major transcripts were 
      observed for dcuB and fumB: monocistronic transcripts for both fumB and dcuB; a 
      dcuB-fumB cotranscript; and two transcripts, possibly corresponding to dcuB-fumB 
      and fumB mRNA degradation products. Primer extension analysis revealed 
      independent promoters for aspA, dcuA, and dcuB, but surprisingly no primer 
      extension product could be detected for fumB. The expression of dcuB is entirely 
      consistent with a primary role for DcuB in mediating C4-dicarboxylate transport 
      during anaerobic fumarate respiration. The precise physiological purpose of DcuA 
      remains unclear.

TI  - The EIIGlc protein is involved in glucose-mediated activation of Escherichia coli 
      gapA and gapB-pgk transcription.
PG  - 6476-83
AB  - The Escherichia coli gapB gene codes for a protein that is very similar to 
      bacterial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPDH). In most bacteria, 
      the gene for GAPDH is located upstream of the pgk gene encoding 
      3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). This is the case for gapB. However, this gene is 
      poorly expressed and encodes a protein with an erythrose 4-phosphate 
      dehydrogenase activity (E4PDH). The active GAPDH is encoded by the gapA gene. 
      Since we found that the nucleotide region upstream of the gapB open reading frame 
      is responsible for part of the PGK production, we analyzed gapB promoter activity 
      in vivo by direct measurement of the mRNA levels by reverse transcription. We 
      showed the presence of a unique transcription promoter, gapB P0, with a cyclic 
      AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP)-cAMP binding site centered 70.5 bp upstream of 
      the start site. Interestingly, the gapB P0 promoter activity was strongly 
      enhanced when glucose was used as the carbon source. In these conditions, 
      deletion of the CRP-cAMP binding site had little effect on promoter gapB P0 
      activity. In contrast, abolition of CRP production or of cAMP biosynthesis (crp 
      or cya mutant strains) strongly reduced promoter gapB P0 activity. This suggests 
      that in the presence of glucose, the CRP-cAMP complex has an indirect effect on 
      promoter gapB P0 activity. We also showed that glucose stimulation of gapB P0 
      promoter activity depends on the expression of enzyme IIGlc (EIIGlc), encoded by 
      the ptsG gene, and that the gapA P1 promoter is also activated by glucose via the 
      EIIGlc protein. A similar glucose-mediated activation, dependent on the EIIGlc 
      protein, was described by others for the pts operon. Altogether, this shows that 
      when glucose is present in the growth medium expression of the E. coli genes 
      required for its uptake (pts) and its metabolism (gapA and gapB-pgk) are 
      coordinately activated by a mechanism dependent upon the EIIGlc protein.

TI  - Inducer exclusion in Escherichia coli by non-PTS substrates: the role of the PEP 
      to pyruvate ratio in determining the phosphorylation state of enzyme IIAGlc.
PG  - 487-98
AB  - The main mechanism causing catabolite repression in Escherichia coli is the 
      dephosphorylation of enzyme IIAGlc, one of the enzymes of the 
      phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS is 
      involved in the uptake of a large number of carbohydrates that are phosphorylated 
      during transport, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) being the phosphoryl donor. 
      Dephosphorylation of enzyme IIAGlc causes inhibition of uptake of a number of 
      non-PTS carbon sources, a process called inducer exclusion. In this paper, we 
      show that dephosphorylation of enzyme IIAGlc is not only caused by the transport 
      of PTS carbohydrates, as has always been thought, and that an additional 
      mechanism causing dephosphorylation exists. Direct monitoring of the 
      phosphorylation state of enzyme IIAGlc also showed that many carbohydrates that 
      are not transported by the PTS caused dephosphorylation during growth. In the 
      case of glucose 6-phosphate, it was shown that transport and the first metabolic 
      step are not involved in the dephosphorylation of enzyme IIAGlc, but that later 
      steps in the glycolysis are essential. Evidence is provided that the 
      [PEP]-[pyruvate] ratio, the driving force for the phosphorylation of the PTS 
      proteins, determines the phosphorylation state of enzyme IIAGlc. The implications 
      of these new findings for our view on catabolite repression and inducer exclusion 
      are discussed.

TI  - A comprehensive library of DNA-binding site matrices for 55 proteins applied to 
      the complete Escherichia coli K-12 genome.
PG  - 241-54
AB  - A major mode of gene regulation occurs via the binding of specific proteins to 
      specific DNA sequences. The availability of complete bacterial genome sequences 
      offers an unprecedented opportunity to describe networks of such interactions by 
      correlating existing experimental data with computational predictions. Of the 240 
      candidate Escherichia coli DNA-binding proteins, about 55 have DNA-binding sites 
      identified by DNA footprinting. We used these sites to construct recognition 
      matrices, which we used to search for additional binding sites in the E. coli 
      genomic sequence. Many of these matrices show a strong preference for non-coding 
      DNA. Discrepancies are identified between matrices derived from natural sites and 
      those derived from SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential 
      enrichment) experiments. We have constructed a database of these proteins and 
      binding sites, called DPInteract (available at 
      http://arep.med.harvard.edu/dpinteract).

TI  - Transcription of rpoH, encoding the Escherichia coli heat-shock regulator 
      sigma32, is negatively controlled by the cAMP-CRP/CytR nucleoprotein complex.
PG  - 1091-9
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the rpoH gene encoding the essential heat-shock regulator 
      sigma32, is expressed in a complex manner. Transcription occurs from four 
      promoters (P1, P3, P4 and P5) and is modulated by several factors including (i) 
      two sigma factors (sigma70 and sigmaE); (ii) the global regulator CRP; and (iii) 
      the DnaA protein. Here, a further dissection of the rpoH regulatory region has 
      revealed that an additional transcription control exists that appears to link 
      rpoH expression to nucleoside metabolism. The cAMP-CRP complex and the CytR 
      anti-activator bind co-operatively to the promoter region forming a repression 
      complex that overlaps the sigmaE-dependent P3 promoter and the sigma70-dependent 
      P4 and P5 promoters. During steady-state growth conditions with glycerol as the 
      carbon and energy source, transcription from P3, P4 and P5 is reduced 
      approximately threefold by CytR, whereas transcription from the upstream 
      promoter, P1, appears to be unaffected. Furthermore, in strains that slightly 
      overproduce CytR, transcription from P3, P4 and P5 is reduced even further 
      (approximately 10-fold), and repression can be fully neutralized by the addition 
      of the inducer cytidine to the growth medium. In the induced state, P4 is the 
      strongest promoter and, together with P3 and P5, it is responsible for most rpoH 
      transcription (65-70%). At present, CytR has been shown to 'fine tune' 
      transcription of two genes (rpoH and ppiA) that are connected with 
      protein-folding activities. These findings suggest that additional assistance in 
      protein folding is required under conditions in which CytR is induced (i.e. in 
      the presence of nucleosides).

TI  - Expression of ptsG, the gene for the major glucose PTS transporter in Escherichia 
      coli, is repressed by Mlc and induced by growth on glucose.
PG  - 1053-63
AB  - The gene for the glucose-specific transporter of the phosphotransferase system, 
      ptsG, is expressed from two promoters separated by 141 bp. The expression of the 
      major, shorter transcript is very strongly dependent upon cAMP/CAP. However, 
      unlike other CAP-activated genes, the expression of ptsG is higher in glucose 
      media than in glycerol, implying that ptsG is controlled by a glucose-inducible 
      regulator. A mutation in the mlc gene greatly enhances ptsG expression in a 
      glycerol-grown culture but has no effect on ptsG expression during growth on 
      glucose. The mlc gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that has been shown to 
      affect the expression of manXYZ and malT. ptsG mRNA levels are lower in the mlc 
      strain grown on glucose than in the same strain grown on glycerol. This is 
      presumably because of the greater catabolite repression in the glucose culture 
      than in glycerol. The final level of expression of ptsG in a mlc+ strain in 
      glucose is a compromise between specific induction by glucose and generalized 
      catabolite repression. The result is that ptsG expression is very similar in 
      glucose-grown cultures of wild-type and mlc strains. The Mlc protein binds to two 
      sites centred at -6 and -175 upstream of the major ptsG transcript. CAP binds at 
      -40.5 compared with this site, typical of class II CAP-regulated promoters, and 
      the binding of CAP and Mlc is co-operative.

TI  - CAP, the -45 region, and RNA polymerase: three partners in transcription 
      initiation at lacP1 in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 495-504
AB  - The lac operon of Escherichia coli is positively regulated by the catabolite 
      activator protein (CAP) bound upstream of the -45 region (CAP binding is centered 
      at -61.5; the -45 region extends from -50 to -38). Certain mutations within the 
      -45 region generate sequences that resemble UP elements in base composition and 
      mimic the stimulation by the rrnBP1 UP element, yielding up to 15-fold 
      stimulation in vivo. These -45 region "UP mutants" are compromised in their CAP 
      stimulation. CAP and UP elements do not act in a fully additive manner in vivo at 
      the lac operon. Transcription assays with the wild-type lac promoter and an UP 
      mutant of lac indicate that CAP and UP DNA also fail to act in a completely 
      additive manner in vitro. RNA polymerase can stabilize CAP binding to promoter 
      DNA with a -45 region UP element against a heparin challenge. This shows that CAP 
      and the UP DNA do not compete for the alpha-CTD as a mechanism for their lack of 
      additivity. CAP and UP elements both demonstrate decreased stimulation of 
      transcription as RNA polymerase concentration is increased from 0.05 to 10 nM in 
      in vitro transcription experiments. In addition CAP also stimulates transcription 
      in a manner that does not decrease as RNA polymerase is varied over this 
      concentration range. This invariable stimulation is by two- to threefold and 
      occurs both in vivo and in vitro. It is not dependent upon the alpha-CTD of RNA 
      polymerase and is maintained in the presence of the AR1 CAP mutant HL159. This 
      two- to threefold invariable CAP stimulation appears to depend on the -45 region 
      sequence as our -45 region mutants demonstrate different responses to HL159 CAP 
      stimulation in vivo.

LID - 10.1099/00221287-144-8-2113 [doi]
AB  - The genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase (sdhCDAB), the specific components of 
      the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (ODH, E1o and E2o; sucAB) and 
      succinyl-CoA synthetase (sucCD) form a cluster containing two promoters at 16.3 
      min in the chromosome of Escherichia coli: Psdh sdhCDAB-Psuc sucAB-sucCD. The 
      gene encoding the lipoamide dehydrogenase component of both the 2-oxoglutarate 
      and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (E3; lpdA) is the distal gene of another 
      cluster containing two promoters located at 2.7 min: Ppdh pdhR-aceEF-Plpd lpdA. 
      The responses of the suc and lpd promoters to different environmental conditions 
      and to regulator defects were investigated with appropriate lacZ fusions, in 
      order to understand how expression of the sucAB genes is co-regulated with other 
      genes in the sdhCDAB-sucABCD cluster and with lpdA expression. Expression from 
      the suc promoter was repressed by IHF and partially activated by sigma 38 but it 
      was not regulated by ArcA, FNR, CRP, FruR or Fis, and not repressed by glucose or 
      anaerobiosis, indicating that the well-established catabolite and anaerobic 
      repression of ODH synthesis is imposed elsewhere. In contrast, the lpd promoter 
      was repressed by both glucose (via a CRP-independent mechanism) and anaerobiosis 
      (mediated by ArcA), and activated by Fis, but it was not regulated by FNR, FruR, 
      IHF or sigma 38. These observations support the view that transcription of the 
      sucABCD genes is primarily initiated and regulated at the upstream sdh promoter, 
      and that the lpd promoter is independently co-regulated with Psdh (primarily by 
      ArcA-mediated repression) rather than with Psuc. Direct evidence for 
      co-transcription of the entire sdhCDAB-sucABCD region from Psdh was obtained by 
      detecting a 10 kb transcript in rnc and rne mutants, but not in the parental 
      strains. Three RNaseIII-specific processing sites, which contribute to the 
      extreme instability of the readthrough transcript, were identified in the 
      sdhCDAB-sucABCD intergenic region. Other sites of endonuclease processing were 
      located by interpreting the patterns of transcript subfragments observed in 
      Northern blotting.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo characterization of three major dadAX promoters in 
      Escherichia coli that are regulated by cyclic AMP-CRP and Lrp.
PG  - 442-7
AB  - We have shown previously that the dadAX operon of Escherichia coli expresses 
      multiple transcripts, which are repressed by leucine-responsive regulatory 
      protein (Lrp). Here we used site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro and in vivo 
      transcription assays to show that each of the three major dad transcripts 
      requires a specific promoter. These promoters, P1-P3, overlap and are positively 
      regulated in vivo by cyclic AMP-CRP. DNase I footprinting experiments localized 
      two CRP binding sites in this region: CRP1, which is positioned upstream of 
      P1-P3, and CRP2, which is located within the promoters. Site-directed mutagenesis 
      of each site provided evidence that CRP1 is necessary for the effects of cyclic 
      AMP-CRP on dad expression in vivo and in vitro, and that CRP2 probably plays 
      little or no role in this process.

TI  - Transcription activation at Class II CRP-dependent promoters: identification of 
      determinants in the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit.
PG  - 3439-47
AB  - Many transcription factors, including the Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor 
      protein (CRP), act by making direct contacts with RNA polymerase. At Class II 
      CRP-dependent promoters, CRP activates transcription by making two such contacts: 
      (i) an interaction with the RNA polymerase alpha subunit C-terminal domain 
      (alphaCTD) that facilitates initial binding of RNA polymerase to promoter DNA; 
      and (ii) an interaction with the RNA polymerase alpha subunit N-terminal domain 
      that facilitates subsequent promoter opening. We have used random mutagenesis and 
      alanine scanning to identify determinants within alphaCTD for transcription 
      activation at a Class II CRP-dependent promoter. Our results indicate that Class 
      II CRP-dependent transcription requires the side chains of residues 265, 271, 
      285-288 and 317. Residues 285-288 and 317 comprise a discrete 20x10 A surface on 
      alphaCTD, and substitutions within this determinant reduce or eliminate 
      cooperative interactions between alpha subunits and CRP, but do not affect DNA 
      binding by alpha subunits. We propose that, in the ternary complex of RNA 
      polymerase, CRP and a Class II CRP-dependent promoter, this determinant in 
      alphaCTD interacts directly with CRP, and is distinct from and on the opposite 
      face to the proposed determinant for alphaCTD-CRP interaction in Class I 
      CRP-dependent transcription.

TI  - Regulation of crp transcription by oscillation between distinct nucleoprotein 
      complexes.
PG  - 2877-85
AB  - FIS belongs to the group of small abundant DNA-binding proteins of Escherichia 
      coli. We recently demonstrated that, in vivo, FIS regulates the expression of 
      several genes needed for catabolism of sugars and nucleic acids, a majority of 
      which are also transcriptionally regulated by cAMP-cAMP-receptor protein (CRP) 
      complex. Here we provide evidence that FIS represses transcription of the crp 
      gene both in vivo and in vitro. Employing crp promoter-lacZ fusions, we 
      demonstrate that both FIS and cAMP-CRP are required to keep the crp promoter in a 
      repressed state. We have identified in the crp promoter other transcription 
      initiation sites which are located 73, 79 and 80 bp downstream from the 
      previously mapped start site. Two CRP- and several FIS-binding sites with 
      different affinities are located in the crp promoter region, one of them 
      overlapping the downstream transcription initiation sites. We show that 
      initiation of transcription at the crp promoter is affected by the composition of 
      nucleoprotein complexes resulting from the outcome of competition between 
      proteins for overlapping binding sites. Our results suggest that the control of 
      crp transcription is achieved by oscillation in the composition of these 
      regulatory nucleoprotein complexes in response to the physiological state of the 
      cell.

TI  - Regulation of the carnitine pathway in Escherichia coli: investigation of the 
      cai-fix divergent promoter region.
PG  - 2599-608
AB  - The divergent structural operons caiTABCDE and fixABCX of Escherichia coli are 
      required for anaerobic carnitine metabolism. Transcriptional monocopy lacZ fusion 
      studies showed that both operons are coexpressed during anaerobic growth in the 
      presence of carnitine, respond to common environmental stimuli (like glucose and 
      nitrate), and are modulated positively by the same general regulators, CRP and 
      FNR, and negatively by H-NS. Overproduction of the CaiF specific regulatory 
      protein mediating the carnitine signal restored induction in an fnr mutant, 
      corresponding to its role as the primary target for anaerobiosis. Transcript 
      analysis identified two divergent transcription start points initiating 289 bp 
      apart. DNase I footprinting revealed three sites with various affinities for the 
      binding of the cAMP-CRP complex inside this regulatory region. Site-directed 
      mutagenesis experiments indicated that previously reported perfect CRP motif 1, 
      centered at -41.5 of the cai transcriptional start site, plays a direct role in 
      the sole cai activation. In contrast, mutation in CRP site 2, positioned at -69.5 
      of the fix promoter, caused only a threefold reduction in fix expression. Thus, 
      the role of the third CRP site, located at -126.5 of fix, might be to reinforce 
      the action of site 2. A critical 50-bp cis-acting sequence overlapping the fix 
      mRNA start site was found, by deletion analysis, to be necessary for cai 
      transcription. This region is thought to be involved in transduction of the 
      signal mediated by the CaiF regulator.

TI  - Positive and negative transcriptional regulation of the Escherichia coli 
      gluconate regulon gene gntT by GntR and the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor 
      protein complex.
PG  - 1777-85
AB  - The gntT gene of Escherichia coli is specifically induced by gluconate and 
      repressed via catabolite repression. Thus, gluconate is both an inducer and a 
      repressor of gntT expression since gluconate is a catabolite-repressing sugar. In 
      a gntR deletion mutant, the expression of a chromosomal gntT::lacZ fusion is both 
      high and constitutive, confirming that GntR is the negative regulator of gntT. 
      Indeed, GntR binds to two consensus gnt operator sites; one overlaps the -10 
      region of the gntT promoter, and the other is centered at +120 with respect to 
      the transcriptional start site. The binding of GntR to these sites was proven in 
      vitro by gel redardation assays and in vivo by site-directed mutagenesis of the 
      binding sites. Binding of GntR to the operators is eliminated by gluconate and 
      also by 6-phosphogluconate at a 10-fold-higher concentration. Interestingly, when 
      gntR deletion strains are grown in the presence of gluconate, there is a twofold 
      decrease in gntT expression which is independent of catabolite repression and 
      binding of GntR to the operator sites. This novel response of gntR mutants to the 
      inducer is termed ultrarepression. Transcription of gntT is activated by binding 
      of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex to a CRP binding 
      site positioned at -71 upstream of the gntT transcription start site.

TI  - DNA bending and expression of the divergent nagE-B operons.
PG  - 1254-60
AB  - Repression of the divergent nagE - B operons requires NagC binding to two 
      operators which overlap the nagE and nagB promoters, resulting in formation of a 
      DNA loop. Binding of the cAMP/CAP activator to its site, adjacent to the nagE 
      operator, stabilizes the DNA loop in vitro. The DNA of the nagE-B intergenic 
      region is intrinsically bent, with the bend centred on the CAP site. We show that 
      displacement of the CAP site by 6 bp results in complete derepression of the two 
      operons. This derepression is observed even in the absence of cAMP/CAP binding 
      and despite the fact that the two NagC operators are still in phase, 
      demonstrating that the inherently bent structure of the DNA loop is important for 
      repression. Since no interaction between NagC and CAP has been detected, we 
      propose that the role of CAP in the repression loop is architectural, stabilizing 
      the intrinsic bend. The cAMP/CAP complex is necessary for activation of the 
      nagE-B promoters. In this case protein-protein contacts between CAP and RNA 
      polymerase are necessary for full activation, but at least a part of the 
      activation is likely due to an effect of CAP binding altering DNA structure.

TI  - Multiple promoters are responsible for transcription of the glpEGR operon of 
      Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 114-26
AB  - The transcriptional organization of the glpEGR genes of Escherichia coli was 
      studied. Besides a promoter located upstream of the glpE start codon, three 
      internal glpGR promoters were identified that express glpG and/or glpR (glp 
      repressor). One promoter was located just upstream of the glpG start codon and 
      two others (separated by several hundred base pairs) were located within glpG 
      upstream of the glpR start codon. The transcriptional start points of these 
      promoters were identified by primer extension analysis. The strengths of the 
      individual promoters were compared by analysis of their expression when fused to 
      a pormoter-probe vector. Analysis of the transcriptional expression of the glpEGR 
      sequence with different combinations of the glpEGR promoters revealed no internal 
      transcriptional terminators within the entire operon. Thus, the glpEGR genes are 
      co-transcribed and form a single complex operon. The presence of multiple 
      promoters may provide for differential expression of glpE, glpG and glpR. 
      Potential regulation of the operon promoters by GlpR, catabolite repression, 
      anaerobiosis or by FIS was studied. The glpE promoter was apparently controlled 
      by the cAMP-CRP complex, but none of the promoters was responsive to specific 
      repression by GlpR, to anaerobiosis or to FIS. Specific repression exerted by 
      GlpR was characterized in vivo using glpD-lacZ and glpK-lacZ fusions. The degree 
      of repression was correlated with the level of GlpR expression, and was 
      inefficient when the glpD-encoded glycerol-P dehydrogenase was absent, presumably 
      due to accumulation of the inducer, glycerol-P. This is in contrast to the 
      previous conclusion that gpsA-encoded glycerol-P synthase tightly controls the 
      cellular level of glycerol-P by end product inhibition.

TI  - Molecular analysis of the regulation of csiD, a carbon starvation-inducible gene 
      in Escherichia coli that is exclusively dependent on sigma s and requires 
      activation by cAMP-CRP.
PG  - 339-53
AB  - The general stress-induced sigma subunit sigma s of Escherichia coli RNA 
      polymerase is closely related to the vegetative sigma factor sigma 70. In view of 
      their very similar promoter specificity in vitro, it is unclear how sigma factor 
      selectivity in the expression of sigma s-dependent genes is generated in vivo. 
      The csiD gene is such a strongly sigma s-dependent gene. In contrast to sigma s, 
      which is induced in response to many different stresses, csiD, whose expression 
      is driven from a single promoter, is induced by carbon starvation only. To our 
      knowledge, the csiD promoter is the first characterized promoter which is not 
      only exclusively dependent on sigma s-containing RNA polymerase (E sigma s), but 
      also requires an activator, cAMP-CRP. In addition, leucine-responsive regulatory 
      protein (Lrp) acts as a positive modulator of csiD expression. Also in vitro, E 
      sigma s is more efficient than E sigma 70 in csiD promoter binding, open complex 
      formation and run-off transcription, which might be due to the poor match of the 
      csiD -35 region to the sigma 70 consensus and to transcription by E sigma s being 
      less dependent on contacts in this region. By DNase I protection experiments, a 
      cAMP-CRP binding site centered at -68.5 nucleotides upstream of the csiD 
      transcriptional start site was identified. While cAMP-CRP stimulates E sigma 70 
      binding, it does not promote open complex formation by E sigma 70, but does so in 
      conjunction with E sigma s. With linear templates, cAMP-CRP significantly 
      stimulates E sigma s-mediated in vitro transcription, whereas transcription by E 
      sigma 70 is negligible and hardly stimulated by cAMP-CRP. These findings may 
      reflect different or less stringent positional requirements for an activator site 
      for E sigma s than for E sigma 70, and indicate that cAMP-CRP contributes to 
      sigma factor selectivity at the csiD promoter. In vitro transcription experiments 
      with super-coiled templates, however, revealed significant cAMP-CRP-stimulated 
      transcription also by E sigma 70. Yet, under these conditions, H-NS was found to 
      restore E sigma s specificity by strongly interfering with cAMP-CRP/E sigma 
      70-dependent transcription. Lrp strongly and cooperatively binds to multiple 
      sites located between positions -14 and -102 (in a way that suggests DNA wrapping 
      around multiple Lrp molecules) and moderately stimulates in vitro transcription, 
      especially with E sigma s. In summary, we conclude that the csiD promoter has an 
      intrinsic preference for E sigma s, but that also protein factors such as 
      cAMP-CRP, Lrp and probably H-NS as well as DNA conformation contribute to its 
      strong E sigma s selectivity. Furthermore, this strong E sigma s preference in 
      combination with a requirement for high concentrations of the essential activator 
      cAMP-CRP ensures csiD expression under conditions of carbon starvation, but not 
      other stress conditions.

TI  - Negative transcriptional regulation of a positive regulator: the expression of 
      malT, encoding the transcriptional activator of the maltose regulon of 
      Escherichia coli, is negatively controlled by Mlc.
PG  - 381-90
AB  - The maltose regulon consists of 10 genes encoding a multicomponent and binding 
      protein-dependent ABC transporter for maltose and maltodextrins as well as 
      enzymes necessary for the degradation of these sugars. MalT, the transcriptional 
      activator of the system, is necessary for the transcription of all mal genes. 
      MalK, the energy-transducing subunit of the transport system, acts phenotypically 
      as repressor, particularly when overproduced. We isolated an insertion mutation 
      that strongly reduced the repressing effect of overproduced MalK. The affected 
      gene was sequenced and identified as mlc, a known gene encoding a protein of 
      unknown function with homology to the Escherichia coli NagC protein. The loss of 
      Mlc function led to a threefold increase in malT expression, and the presence of 
      mlc on a multicopy plasmid reduced malT expression. By DNasel protection assay, 
      we found that Mlc protected a DNA region comprising positions +1 to +23 of the 
      malT transcriptional start point. Using a mlc-lacZ fusion in a mlc and mlc+ 
      background, we found that Mlc represses its own expression. As Mlc also regulates 
      another operon (manXYZ, see pages 369-379 of this issue), it may very well 
      constitute a new global regulator of carbohydrate utilization.

TI  - Control of the expression of the manXYZ operon in Escherichia coli: Mlc is a 
      negative regulator of the mannose PTS.
PG  - 369-80
AB  - The manXYZ operon of Escherichia coli encodes a sugar transporter of the 
      phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system, which is capable 
      of transporting many sugars, including glucose, mannose and the aminosugars, 
      glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine. Transcription of manX is strongly dependent 
      on cyclic AMP (cAMP)/cAMP receptor protein (CAP). A cAMP/CAP binding site is 
      located at -40.5, and activation by cAMP/CAP is shown to be typical of a class II 
      promoter. The 5' end of a transcript, potentially encoding two proteins, is 
      expressed divergently from the manXYZ operon. Previously, two binding sites for 
      the NagC repressor were detected upstream of manX, but a mutation in nagC has 
      very little effect on manX expression. However, a mutation in the mlc gene, 
      encoding a homologue of nagC, results in a threefold derepression of manX 
      expression, suggesting that this protein is a more important regulator of manX 
      expression than NagC. The Mlc protein binds to the NagC operators, binding 
      preferentially to the promoter-proximal operator. Plasmids overproducing either 
      the NagC protein or the Mlc protein repress the expression of manX, but the 
      effect of the Mlc protein is stronger. The mlc gene is shown to be allelic with 
      the previously characterized dgsA mutation affecting the mannose 
      phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS).

TI  - Modulation of Escherichia coli adenylyl cyclase activity by catalytic-site 
      mutants of protein IIA(Glc) of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase 
      system.
PG  - 732-6
AB  - It is demonstrated here that in Escherichia coli, the phosphorylated form of the 
      glucose-specific phosphocarrier protein IIA(Glc) of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar 
      phosphotransferase system is an activator of adenylyl cyclase and that 
      unphosphorylated IIA(Glc) has no effect on the basal activity of adenylyl 
      cyclase. To elucidate the specific role of IIA(Glc) phosphorylation in the 
      regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, both the phosphorylatable histidine 
      (H90) and the interactive histidine (H75) of IIA(Glc) were mutated by 
      site-directed mutagenesis to glutamine and glutamate. Wild-type IIA(Glc) and the 
      H75Q mutant, in which the histidine in position 75 has been replaced by 
      glutamine, were phosphorylated by the phosphohistidine-containing phosphocarrier 
      protein (HPr-P) and were equally potent activators of adenylyl cyclase. Neither 
      the H90Q nor the H90E mutant of IIA(Glc) was phosphorylated by HPr-P, and both 
      failed to activate adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, replacement of H75 by glutamate 
      inhibited the appearance of a steady-state level of phosphorylation of H90 of 
      this mutant protein by HPr-P, yet the H75E mutant of IIA(Glc) was a partial 
      activator of adenylyl cyclase. The H75E H90A double mutant, which cannot be 
      phosphorylated, did not activate adenylyl cyclase. This suggests that the H75E 
      mutant was transiently phosphorylated by HPr-P but the steady-state level of the 
      phosphorylated form of the mutant protein was decreased due to the repulsive 
      forces of the negatively charged glutamate at position 75 in the catalytic 
      pocket. These results are discussed in the context of the proximity of H75 and 
      H90 in the IIA(Glc) structure and the disposition of the negative charge in the 
      modeled glutamate mutants.

TI  - Catabolite gene activator protein mutations affecting activity of the araBAD 
      promoter.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - We have studied catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) activation at the araBAD 
      promoter, pBAD, in the absence of DNA looping. We ruled out the two most 
      plausible indirect activation mechanisms: CAP-induced folding of upstream DNA 
      back upon RNA polymerase, and CAP-induced stabilization of AraC binding to DNA. 
      Therefore, a direct CAP-RNA polymerase interaction seemed likely. We sought and 
      found CAP mutants defective in transcription activation at pBAD that retained 
      normal DNA binding affinity. Some mutations altered residues in the interval from 
      positions 150 to 164 that includes CAP activating region 1 (AR1), which has been 
      shown to contact RNA polymerase at a number of promoters. Unexpectedly, 
      additional mutations were found that altered residues in the region between 
      positions 46 and 68 and at position 133. This includes the region known as 
      activating region 3 (AR3). Mutations from both groups also affect the araFGH and 
      rhaBAD promoters.

      coli.
PG  - 3795-3805
LID - 10.1099/00221287-143-12-3795 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli contains two differentially regulated aconitase genes, acnA and 
      acnB. Two acnA promoters transcribing from start points located 407 bp (P1acnA) 
      and 50 bp (P2acnA) upstream of the acnA coding region, and one acnB promoter 
      (PacnB) with a start point 95 bp upstream of the acnB coding region, were 
      identified by primer extension analysis. A 2.8 kb acnA monocistronic transcript 
      was detected by Northern blot hybridization, but only in redox-stressed 
      (methyl-viologen-treated) cultures, and a 2.5 kb acnB monocistronic transcript 
      was detected in exponential- but not stationary-phase cultures. These findings 
      are consistent with previous observations that acnA is specifically subject to 
      SoxRS-mediated activation, whereas acnB encodes the major aconitase that is 
      synthesized earlier in the growth cycle than AcnA. Further studies with acn-lacZ 
      gene fusions and a wider range of transcription regulators indicated that acnA 
      expression is initiated by sigma 38 from P1acnA, and from P2acnA it is activated 
      directly or indirectly by CRP, FruR, Fur and SoxRS, and repressed by ArcA and 
      FNR. In contrast, acnB expression is activated by CRP and repressed by ArcA, FruR 
      and Fis from PacnB. Comparable studies with fum-lacZ fusions indicated that 
      transcription of fumC, but not of fumA or fumB, is initiated by RNA polymerase 
      containing sigma 38. It is concluded that AcnB is the major citric acid cycle 
      enzyme, whereas AcnA is an aerobic stationary-phase enzyme that is specifically 
      induced by iron and redox-stress.

TI  - Organization and regulation of the D-xylose operons in Escherichia coli K-12: 
      XylR acts as a transcriptional activator.
PG  - 7025-32
AB  - The metabolism of D-xylose in Escherichia coli K-12 is known to be mediated by 
      the xylAB gene. However, the nearby xylFGHR genes were found by genome sequencing 
      and predicted to be responsible for transport and regulation for xylose based on 
      their sequence similarities to other functionally related genes. Here, we 
      investigated transcriptional organization and functions of the xyl genes. An 
      analysis with random transposon insertions revealed that the xyl genes are 
      organized into two major transcriptional units, xylAB and xylFGHR, governed by 
      the promoters PA and PF, respectively. However, there is an additional weak 
      promoter, PR, which is specific for xylR. Sites of transcription initiation were 
      determined by primer extension analysis. When studied with operon fusions to 
      lacZ, the PA and PF promoters were activated by D-xylose and repressed by 
      glucose. In contrast, the PR promoter was not regulated by these sugars. A 
      mutation in xylR completely abolished expression from the PA and PF promoters, 
      causing a defect in both growth and transport. Binding of XylR to the xyl 
      promoter was enhanced by the presence of D-xylose, suggesting that transcription 
      was positively regulated by XylR. In vivo footprinting analysis revealed that 
      XylR binds to at least two DNA regions, IA and IF, each with a direct repeat. It 
      is very likely that XylR interacts with IA and IF as a dimer. The presumed 
      binding sites are located just upstream of the promoter consensus sequences 
      (-35), while IA is additionally flanked by a cyclic AMP receptor protein-binding 
      site on the other side. The proposed structure of xyl promoters is consistent 
      with the regulation of xyl gene expression and with phenotypes of transposon 
      insertions obtained in the promoter regions.

AB  - We characterized the gntT gene encoding a high-affinity gluconate permease of 
      Escherichia coli K-12. Primer extension and lacZ-operon fusion analyses revealed 
      that gntT has one strong and two weak promoters, all of which are regulated 
      positively by cAMP-CRP and negatively by GntR. The weak promoters became 
      constitutive when separated from the upstream region including the strong 
      promoter that overlaps a putative GntR-binding sequence. Gluconate-specific 
      uptake activity was observed with cells harboring the gntT plasmid clone, which 
      was enhanced by the presence of gntK encoding gluconate kinase.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the Escherichia coli oxyR gene as a function of 
      cell growth.
PG  - 6181-6
AB  - The oxyR regulon plays a central role in the defense of Escherichia coli against 
      the endogenous oxidative damage associated with active aerobic growth. Here we 
      have studied the transcriptional regulation of oxyR in E. coli growing 
      aerobically in rich medium. Expression of a single-copy oxyR'::lacZ reporter 
      construct varied sixfold along the growth curve, with the highest value at 4 to 6 
      h of growth (approximately 14 x 10(8) cells x ml(-1)). Direct measurements of 
      oxyR mRNA by primer extension showed the same biphasic expression but with a peak 
      somewhat earlier in cell growth (2 to 3 h; approximately 3.5 x 10(8) cells x 
      ml(-1)). The results of immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that the level of 
      OxyR protein exhibits the same biphasic expression. Mutant strains lacking 
      adenylate cyclase (cya) or Crp protein (crp) failed to increase oxyR expression 
      during exponential growth. On the other hand, an rpoS mutation allowed oxyR 
      expression to continue increasing as the cells entered stationary phase. 
      Consistent with a biological role for increased levels of OxyR during exponential 
      growth, the crp cya strain had lower activities of catalase hydroperoxidase I and 
      glutathione reductase and an increased sensitivity to exogenously added hydrogen 
      peroxide. These results suggest that the Crp-dependent upregulation of oxyR in 
      exponential phase is a component of a multistep strategy to counteract endogenous 
      oxidative stress in actively growing E. coli cells.

TI  - Structural kinetics of transcription activation at the malT promoter of 
      Escherichia coli by UV laser footprinting.
PG  - 9022-7
AB  - We have studied the kinetics of transcriptional initiation and activation at the 
      malT and malTp1 promoters of Escherichia coli using UV laser footprinting. 
      Contrary to previous studies and because of the very rapid signal acquisition by 
      this technique, we can obtain structural information about true reaction 
      intermediates of transcription initiation. The consequences of adding a 
      transcriptional activator, the cAMP receptor protein/cAMP complex (CRP), are 
      monitored in real time, permitting us to assign specific interactions to the 
      activation of discrete steps in transcription initiation. Direct protein-protein 
      contacts between CRP and the RNA polymerase appeared very rapidly, followed by 
      DNA melting around the -10 hexamer. CRP slightly increased the rate of this 
      isomerization reaction but, more importantly, favored the establishment of 
      additional contacts between the DNA upstream of the CRP binding site and RNA 
      polymerase subsequent to open complex formation. These contacts make a major 
      contribution to transcriptional activation by stabilizing open forms of the 
      promoter complex, thereby indirectly accelerating promoter escape. The ensemble 
      of the kinetic, structural signals demonstrated directly that CRP exerts most of 
      its activating effects on the late stages of transcriptional initiation at the 
      malT promoter.

TI  - The aldA gene of Escherichia coli is under the control of at least three 
      transcriptional regulators.
PG  - 2085-2095
LID - 10.1099/00221287-143-6-2085 [doi]
AB  - Expression studies on the aldA gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase in 
      Escherichia coli showed induction by two types of molecule (hydroxyaldehydes and 
      2-oxoglutarate), carbon catabolite repression and respiration dependence. 
      Promoter deletion analysis showed that the proximal operator, which includes 
      inducer-regulator complex and catabolite repression protein (Crp) recognition 
      sites, was necessary for induction by either type of inducer, and that full 
      induction by aldehydes required the cooperation of distal operator sequences 
      beyond position -119. Interactions of the regulator protein with the -59 to -6 
      fragment were shown by DNA mobility shift assays. Fusions of different deletions 
      of the aldA promoter to lacZ indicated that a Crp site proximal to the 
      transcriptional start point (tsp) was functional in the cAMP-dependent catabolite 
      repression of this system, whereas a distal control site was likely to operate in 
      a cAMP-independent catabolite repression. DNA mobility shift and footprint 
      analyses showed that only the tsp proximal site was bound by pure Crp with a Kd 
      of 5.4 x 10(-7) M. As shown by an Arc-defective strain, the aldA gene seems to be 
      repressed by the Arc system under anaerobiosis, displaying its physiological full 
      induction and activity in the presence of oxygen.

TI  - Maximization of transcription of the serC (pdxF)-aroA multifunctional operon by 
      antagonistic effects of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein-cAMP complex and 
      Lrp global regulators of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 3458-69
AB  - The arrangement of the Escherichia coli serC (pdxF) and aroA genes into a 
      cotranscribed multifunctional operon allows coregulation of two enzymes required 
      for the biosynthesis of L-serine, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, chorismate, and the 
      aromatic amino acids and vitamins. RNase T2 protection assays revealed two major 
      transcripts that were initiated from a promoter upstream from serC (pdxF). 
      Between 80 to 90% of serC (pdxF) transcripts were present in single-gene mRNA 
      molecules that likely arose by Rho-independent termination between serC (pdxF) 
      and aroA. serC (pdxF)-aroA cotranscripts terminated at another Rho-independent 
      terminator near the end of aroA. We studied operon regulation by determining 
      differential rates of beta-galactosidase synthesis in a merodiploid strain 
      carrying a single-copy lambda[phi(serC [pdxF]'-lacZYA)] operon fusion. serC 
      (pdxF) transcription was greatest in bacteria growing in minimal salts-glucose 
      medium (MMGlu) and was reduced in minimal salts-glycerol medium, enriched MMGlu, 
      and LB medium. serC (pdxF) transcription was increased in cya or crp mutants 
      compared to their cya+ crp+ parent in MMGlu or LB medium. In contrast, serC 
      (pdxF) transcription decreased in an lrp mutant compared to its lrp+ parent in 
      MMGlu. Conclusions obtained by using the operon fusion were corroborated by 
      quantitative Western immunoblotting of SerC (PdxF), which was present at around 
      1,800 dimers per cell in bacteria growing in MMGlu. RNase T2 protection assays of 
      serC (pdxF)-terminated and serC (pdxF)-aroA cotranscript amounts supported the 
      conclusion that the operon was regulated at the transcription level under the 
      conditions tested. Results with a series of deletions upstream of the P(serC 
      (pdxF)) promoter revealed that activation by Lrp was likely direct, whereas 
      repression by the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein-cAMP complex (CRP-cAMP) was 
      likely indirect, possibly via a repressor whose amount or activity was stimulated 
      by CRP-cAMP.

TI  - Expression of the Escherichia coli thioredoxin gene is negatively regulated by 
      cyclic AMP.
PG  - 564-7
AB  - Regulation of the Escherichia coli thioredoxin gene (trxA) was studied using 
      trxA-lac translational fusion constructed in the vector pMC1403. Synthesis of 
      beta-galactosidase from the trxA-lac fusion was found to be repressed in the 
      presence of lactose. A switch of carbon source from glucose to lactose and an 
      addition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) caused a decrease in beta-galactosidase synthesis 
      from the trxA-lac fusion. The repression effect of exogenous cAMP was not 
      observed in the crp mutant strain. The beta-galactosidase synthesis from the 
      trxA-lac fusion lacking a plausible cAMP-CRP binding site was not lowered in the 
      presence of lactose or in the addition of cAMP. Expression of the chromosomal 
      trxA gene was reduced by exogenous cAMP. These findings indicate that the 
      expression of the trxA gene is controlled by cAMP in a negative manner.

TI  - Action at a distance for glp repressor control of glpTQ transcription in 
      Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 511-21
AB  - The adjacent, divergently transcribed glpACB and glpTQ operons of Escherichia 
      coli encode the anaerobic glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol 
      3-phosphate transporter/phosphodiesterase, respectively. These operons are 
      negatively controlled by glp repressor binding to operators that overlap the glpA 
      promoter elements. Using DNase I footprinting, three additional operators (OT1-3) 
      were identified at positions +307 to +359 within the glpT coding region. To 
      assess a potential regulatory role for these remote operators in vivo, a 
      glpT-lacZ transcriptional fusion containing all of the glpA and glpT operators 
      was constructed. The response of this fusion to the glp repressor was compared to 
      fusion constructs in which OT1 and OT3 were inactivated, either by deletion or by 
      site-directed mutagenesis. It was found that repression of glpT conferred by 
      binding of glp repressor to glpA operators was increased about three- to fourfold 
      upon introduction of the remote glpT operators. In addition, two integration host 
      factor (IHF) binding sites were identified downstream of the glpT transcriptional 
      start site at positions +15 to +51 and +193 to +227. A regulatory role for IHF 
      was demonstrated by showing that repression of glpT mediated by GlpR was 
      decreased about twofold in strains deficient in IHF and that mutations in IHF1 
      and/or IHF2 decreased repression about two- to threefold. The effect of IHF was 
      apparent only when the remote operators were present. All of the results are 
      consistent with a model of repression involving GlpR binding simultaneously to 
      the glpA and remote glpT operators, with intervening DNA forming a loop.

TI  - Gene organization and transcriptional regulation of the gntRKU operon involved in 
      gluconate uptake and catabolism of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 778-93
AB  - We cloned and characterized the gntRKU operon encoding part of the GntI system 
      involved in gluconate uptake and catabolism by Escherichia coli. The operon was 
      shown to encode its repressor, a thermoresistant gluconate kinase, and a low 
      affinity gluconate permease. CAT fusion analysis revealed that the operon has a 
      promoter for gntR and another for gntKU, and that the gntR gene is constitutively 
      expressed, while that of gntKU is regulated positively by the cAMP-CRP complex 
      and negatively by GntR. Read-through transcription from the gntR promoter into 
      gntK was decreased in the presence of GntR, although GntR did not repress its own 
      promoter. In addition, transcriptional attenuation was observed after the gntK 
      gene, so gntU expression is reduced presumably to modulate the production of the 
      low affinity gluconate permease according to the available concentration of 
      gluconate.

TI  - The structure of a CAP-DNA complex having two cAMP molecules bound to each 
      monomer.
PG  - 2843-7
AB  - The 2.2 A resolution crystal structure of the Escherichia coli catabolite gene 
      activator protein (CAP) complexed with cAMP and a 46-bp DNA fragment reveals a 
      second cAMP molecule bound to each protein monomer. The second cAMP is in the syn 
      conformation and is located on the DNA binding domain interacting with the 
      helix-turn-helix, a beta-hairpin from the regulatory domain and the DNA (via 
      water molecules). The presence of this second cAMP site resolves the apparent 
      discrepancy between the NMR and x-ray data on the conformation of cAMP, and 
      explains the cAMP concentration-dependent behaviors of the protein. In addition, 
      this site's close proximity to mutations affecting transcriptional activation and 
      its water-mediated interactions with a DNA recognition residue (E181) and DNA 
      raise the possibility that this site has biological relevance.

TI  - Cyclic AMP receptor protein functions as a repressor of the osmotically inducible 
      promoter proP P1 in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 2410-7
AB  - Transcription of the proP gene, encoding a transporter of the osmoprotectants 
      proline and glycine betaine, is controlled from two promoters, P1 and P2, that 
      respond primarily to osmotic and stationary-phase signals, respectively. The P1 
      promoter is normally expressed at a very low level under low or normal medium 
      osmolarity. We demonstrate that the binding of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor 
      protein (CRP) to a site centered at -34.5 within the promoter is responsible for 
      the low promoter activity under these conditions. A brief period of reduced CRP 
      binding in early log phase corresponds to a transient burst of P1 transcription 
      upon resumption of growth in Luria-Bertani broth. A CRP binding-site mutation or 
      the absence of a functional crp gene leads to high constitutive expression of P1. 
      We show that the binding of CRP-cAMP inhibits transcription by purified RNA 
      polymerase in vitro at P1, but this repression is relieved at moderately high 
      potassium glutamate concentrations. Likewise, open-complex formation at P1 in 
      vivo is inhibited by the presence of CRP under low-osmolarity conditions. Because 
      P1 expression can be further induced by osmotic upshifts in a delta crp strain or 
      in the presence of the CRP binding-site mutation, additional controls exist to 
      osmotically regulate P1 expression.

TI  - Transcriptional activation by FNR and CRP: reciprocity of binding-site 
      recognition.
PG  - 835-45
AB  - Anaerobic expression of the focA pfl operon is dependent on the transcription 
      factors ArcA and FNR and transcription is directed by multiple, anaerobically 
      regulated promoters. A FNR-binding site is centred at -41.5 bp relative to the P6 
      promoter, inactivation of which severely impairs anaerobic expression of the 
      complete operon. Mutations were introduced into this binding site to create a 
      consensus recognition site for the cAMP-receptor protein, CRP (CC-site), and one 
      that was recognised by both CRP and FNR (CF-site). Transcription directed by 
      these mutant binding sites in vivo in different promoter constructs was analysed 
      by primer extension and by constructing lacZ operon fusions. With a derivative 
      including only the P6 promoter and the CF-binding site, transcription was shown 
      to be independent of oxygen and was activated by CRP or FNR. In agreement with 
      previous findings, FNR only activated transcription anaerobically. In a construct 
      including the CC-binding site transcription was strong. CRP dependent and 
      initiated at the identical site to the wild-type promoter. Transcription 
      activation from the CC-site was exquisitely sensitive to low cAMP concentration. 
      Surprisingly, in a crp mutant, anaerobically inducible, FNR-dependent 
      transcription directed by the CC-site was detected, indicating that FNR can 
      recognise a consensus CRP-binding site in vivo. A strain unable to synthesise CRP 
      or FNR exhibited no transcription from the P6 promoter. Essentially the same 
      results were observed in a series of constructs that also included the promoter 
      P7 and its regulatory sequences. Evidence is also presented which demonstrates 
      that CRP activates transcription from the natural FNR-binding site of the P6 
      promoter. In vitro DNA-binding studies showed that CRP specifically interacted 
      with the FNR-binding site, protecting exactly the same sequence as that protected 
      by the FNR protein. Interaction of CRP with the natural FNR-binding site was 
      reduced greater than 50-fold compared to its interaction with the mutant 
      CC-binding site. Although we could not demonstrate that FNR interacted with the 
      CC-binding site in vitro, it did bind to the CF-site giving the same protection 
      as observed with the wild-type FNR-binding site. FNR also activated transcription 
      from the CF-site in vitro, giving further support to the idea that a single 
      functional DNA half-site is sufficient to direct binding and transcription 
      activation by a dimeric transcription factor.

TI  - Carbon source-dependent synthesis of SecB, a cytosolic chaperone involved in 
      protein translocation across Escherichia coli membranes.
PG  - 1077-81
AB  - SecB is a cytosolic chaperone involved in protein translocation across 
      cytoplasmic membranes in Escherichia coli. It has been shown to be required for 
      efficient translocation of a subset of precursor proteins but is not essential 
      for cell viability. This study investigated whether synthesis of SecB is growth 
      rate dependent. Interestingly, the total amount of SecB synthesized in the cells 
      was relatively small. Moreover, the levels of SecB were found to be carbon source 
      dependent since more SecB was produced in cells grown in glycerol media than in 
      cells grown in glucose media, regardless of the growth rate. This is in contrast 
      to the other Sec proteins, whose synthesis is growth rate dependent and not 
      related to glucose as a carbon source. In addition, cyclic AMP (cAMP) partially 
      relieves the lower levels of SecB observed in glucose medium, a compensatory 
      effect that depends on the presence of both cya and crp gene products. Thus, the 
      glucose-dependent synthesis of SecB may be related to the cAMP-cAMP receptor 
      protein complex-mediated activation.

TI  - The -45 region of the Escherichia coli lac promoter: CAP-dependent and 
      CAP-independent transcription.
PG  - 423-9
AB  - The lactose (lac) operon promoter is positively regulated by the catabolite gene 
      activator-cyclic AMP complex (CAP) that binds to the DNA located 61.5 bp upstream 
      of the transcription start site. Between the CAP binding site and the core 
      promoter sequence is a 13-bp sequence (from -38 to -50 [the -45 region]). The 
      possible roles of the -45 region in determining the CAP-independent level of lac 
      expression and in the CAP activation process were studied by isolating and 
      characterizing random multisite mutations. Only a small percentage of mutants 
      have dramatic effects on lac promoter activity. Among the mutations that did 
      affect expression, a 26-fold range in lac promoter activity in vivo was observed 
      in the CAP-independent activity. The highest level of CAP-independent lac 
      expression (13-fold the level of the wild-type lac promoter) correlated with 
      changes in the -40 to -45 sequence and required an intact RNA polymerase alpha 
      subunit for in vitro expression, as expected for an upstream DNA recognition 
      element. Mutant promoters varied in their ability to be stimulated by CAP in 
      vivo, with levels ranging from 2-fold to the wild-type level of 22-fold. Only a 
      change of twofold in responsiveness to CAP could be attributed to direct DNA 
      sequence effects. The -40 to -45 sequence-dependent enhancement of promoter 
      activity and CAP stimulation of promoter activity did not act additively. The 
      mutant promoters also displayed other characteristics, such as the activation of 
      nascent promoter-like activities overlapping lac P1 and, in one case, 
      replicon-dependent changes in promoter activity.

TI  - Multiple specific CytR binding sites at the Escherichia coli deoP2 promoter 
      mediate both cooperative and competitive interactions between CytR and cAMP 
      receptor protein.
PG  - 33242-55
AB  - Binding of cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and CytR mediates both positive and 
      negative control of transcription from Escherichia coli deoP2. Transcription is 
      activated by CRP and repressed by a multi-protein CRP.CytR.CRP complex. The 
      latter is stabilized by cooperative interactions between CRP and CytR. Similar 
      interactions at the other transcriptional units of the CytR regulon coordinate 
      expression of the transport proteins and enzymes required for nucleoside 
      catabolism. A fundamental question in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene 
      regulation is how combinatorial mechanisms of this sort regulate differential 
      expression. To understand the combinatorial control mechanism at deoP2, we have 
      used quantitative footprint and gel shift analysis of CRP and CytR binding to 
      evaluate the distribution of ligation states. By comparison to distributions for 
      other CytR-regulated promoters, we hope to understand the roles of individual 
      states in differential gene expression. The results indicate that CytR binds 
      specifically to multiple sites at deoP2, including both the well recognized CytR 
      site flanked by CRP1 and CRP2 and also sites coincident with CRP1 and CRP2. 
      Binding to these multiple sites yields both cooperative and competitive 
      interactions between CytR and CRP. Based on these findings we propose that CytR 
      functions as a differential modulator of CRP1 versus CRP2-mediated activation. 
      Additional high affinity specific sites are located at deoP1 and near the middle 
      of the 600-base pair sequence separating P1 and P2. Evaluation of the DNA 
      sequence requirement for specific CytR binding suggests that a limited array of 
      contiguous and overlapping CytR sites exists at deoP2. Similar extended arrays, 
      but with different arrangements of overlapping CytR and CRP sites, are found at 
      the other CytR-regulated promoters. We propose that competition and cooperativity 
      in CytR and CRP binding are important to differential regulation of these 
      promoters.

AB  - At Class II catabolite activator protein (CAP)-dependent promoters, CAP activates 
      transcription from a DNA site overlapping the DNA site for RNA polymerase. We 
      show that transcription activation at Class II CAP-dependent promoters requires 
      not only the previously characterized interaction between an activating region of 
      CAP and the RNA polymerase alpha subunit C-terminal domain, but also an 
      interaction between a second, promoter-class-specific activating region of CAP 
      and the RNA polymerase alpha subunit N-terminal domain. We further show that the 
      two interactions affect different steps in transcription initiation. 
      Transcription activation at Class II CAP-dependent promoters provides a paradigm 
      for understanding how an activator can make multiple interactions with the 
      transcription machinery, each interaction being responsible for a specific 
      mechanistic consequence.

TI  - Influence of the location of the cAMP receptor protein binding site on the 
      geometry of a transcriptional activation complex in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 15302-12
AB  - The interactions between the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and RNA polymerase 
      during transcriptional activation at the Escherichia coli malT promoter have been 
      analyzed using a combination of footprinting methods. We show that a closed 
      complex is formed at this promoter in the absence of activator and that CRP 
      merely stabilizes the open complex. The alpha-subunits of the RNA polymerase are 
      involved in this effect as shown by KMnO4 footprinting. The open complex formed 
      in the presence of CRP is structurally identical to the one found at a 
      CRP-independent promoter up-mutant. UV-laser footprinting yields distinct signals 
      for the different protein-DNA interactions within the complex and for 
      interactions between CRP and RNA polymerase. We monitor these signals in promoter 
      variants that place the CRP binding site at different distances upstream of the 
      start site of transcription. Signals within the core promoter region, as well as 
      those located just upstream of the -35 hexamer, are unaffected by the position of 
      the CRP binding site. Contacts of RNA polymerase with the upstream promoter 
      region change in a mutant RNA polymerase containing a truncated alpha-subunit. We 
      conclude that at least one of the alpha-subunits of RNA polymerase binds to DNA 
      upstream of the -35 hexamer and that this interaction is unaffected by the 
      position of the CRP binding site. We discuss models that account for the 
      different activities of CRP in transcriptional activation as a function of 
      promoter geometry.

TI  - Lrp is a direct repressor of the dad operon in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 7234-40
AB  - Expression of the degradative D-amino acid dehydrogenase (dad) operon is known to 
      be increased when Escherichia coli is grown in the presence of D- or L-alanine. 
      Alanine is thought to act as an inducer to block the action of a postulated 
      repressor. This operon is also believed to be regulated by catabolite repression. 
      We have used in vivo and in vitro experiments that show that the dad repressor is 
      the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp). dad expression in a dad-lacZ 
      operon fusion strain was increased four- to sevenfold when cells were grown in 
      minimal medium containing alanine or leucine. A strain lacking Lrp had high-level 
      constitutive dad expression. Gel retardation and footprinting studies revealed 
      that Lrp binds in vitro to multiple sites over a large area in the dad promoter 
      region. This binding was reduced by alanine or leucine. In vitro transcription 
      assays, using a plasmid template and primer extension analysis, identified three 
      major dad transcripts (Tr1, Tr2, and Tr3). The formation of these transcripts was 
      differentially regulated by cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP receptor protein complex, and 
      each was strongly repressed by Lrp. Alanine or leucine completely (for Tr1 and 
      Tr2) or partially (for Tr3) reversed Lrp inhibition. Site-directed mutagenesis of 
      an Lrp binding site strongly reduced Lrp binding and prevented Lrp repression of 
      dad transcription in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, these results strongly 
      suggest that Lrp and alanine or leucine act directly to repress and induce, 
      respectively, transcription of the dad operon.

TI  - Action at a distance for negative control of transcription of the glpD gene 
      encoding sn-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 7090-8
AB  - Aerobic sn-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a cytoplasmic 
      membrane-associated respiratory enzyme encoded by the glpD gene of Escherichia 
      coli. The glpD operon is tightly controlled by cooperative binding of the glp 
      repressor to tandem operators (O(D)1 and O(D)2) that cover the -10 promoter 
      element and 30 bp downstream of the transcription start site. In this work, two 
      additional operators were identified within the glpD structural gene at positions 
      568 to 587 (0(D)3) and 609 to 628 (0(D)4). The two internal operators bound the 
      glp repressor in the presence or absence of the tandem operators (O(D)1 and 
      O(D)2) in vitro, as shown by DNase I footprinting. To assess a potential 
      regulatory role for the two internal operators in vivo, a glpD-lacZ 
      transcriptional fusion containing all four operators was constructed. The 
      response of this fusion to the glp repressor was compared with those of fusion 
      constructs in which O(D)3 and O(D)4 were inactivated by either deletion or 
      site-directed mutagenesis. It was found that the repression conferred by binding 
      of the glp repressor to O(D)1 and O(D)2 was increased five- to sevenfold upon 
      introduction of the internal operators. A regulatory role for HU was suggested 
      when it was found that repressor-mediated control of glpD transcription was 
      increased fourfold in strains containing HU compared with that of strains 
      deficient in HU. The effect of HU was apparent only in the presence of all four 
      glpD operators. The results suggest that glpD is controlled by formation of a 
      repression loop between the tandem and internal operators. HU may assist 
      repression by bending the DNA to facilitate loop formation.

TI  - Repressor for the sn-glycerol 3-phosphate regulon of Escherichia coli K-12: 
      primary structure and identification of the DNA-binding domain.
PG  - 7080-9
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the glpEGR operon of Escherichia coli was determined. 
      The translational reading frame at the beginning, middle, and end of each gene 
      was verified. The glpE gene encodes an acidic, cytoplasmic protein of 108 amino 
      acids with a molecular weight of 12,082. The glpG gene encodes a basic, 
      cytoplasmic membrane-associated protein of 276 amino acids with a molecular 
      weight of 31,278. The functions of GlpE and GlpG are unknown. The glpR gene 
      encodes the repressor for the glycerol 3-phosphate regulon, a protein predicted 
      to contain 252 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 28,048. The 
      amino acid sequence of the glp repressor was similar to several repressors of 
      carbohydrate catabolic systems, including those of the glucitol (GutR), fucose 
      (FucR), and deoxyribonucleoside (DeoR) systems of E. coli, as well as those of 
      the lactose (LacR) and inositol (IolR) systems of gram-positive bacteria and 
      agrocinopine (AccR) system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. These repressors 
      constitute a family of related proteins, all of which contain approximately 250 
      amino acids, possess a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif near the amino 
      terminus, and bind a sugar phosphate molecule as the inducing signal. The DNA 
      recognition helix of the glp repressor and the nucleotide sequence of the glp 
      operator were very similar to those of the deo system. The presumptive 
      recognition helix of the glp repressor was changed by site-directed mutagenesis 
      to match that of the deo repressor or, in a separate construct, to abolish DNA 
      binding. Neither altered form of the glp repressor recognized the glp or deo 
      operator, either in vivo or in vitro. However, both altered forms of the glp 
      repressor were negatively dominant to the wild-type glp repressor, indicating 
      that the inability to bind DNA with high affinity was due to alteration of the 
      DNA-binding domain, not to an inability to oligomerize or instability of the 
      altered repressors. For the first time, analysis of repressors with altered 
      DNA-binding domains has verified the assignment of the helix-turn-helix motif of 
      the transcriptional regulators in the deoR family.

TI  - Down regulation of cAMP production by cAMP receptor protein in Escherichia coli: 
      an assessment of the contributions of transcriptional and posttranscriptional 
      control of adenylate cyclase.
PG  - 198-204
AB  - Escherichia coli cells that are deficient in the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 
      overproduce cAMP. We and others have previously found that transcription of the 
      adenylate cyclase gene (cya) is negatively regulated by the CRP-cAMP complex. 
      Here, we have investigated the contribution of this transcriptional regulation to 
      the control of cAMP levels. Several variants of the cya gene have been 
      constructed and characterized with respect to their expression and their ability 
      to produce cAMP. Overproduction of cAMP in a crp- background was reduced from 
      200-fold to 50-fold when transcriptional regulation by CRP-cAMP was eliminated by 
      replacing the cya promoter with the constitutive bla promoter. When the 
      C-terminal 48 amino acids of adenylate cyclase were deleted without changing the 
      promoter, the degree of overproduction of cAMP was reduced to 4-fold. Finally, 
      the increase in cAMP level observed in crp- cells was almost completely abolished 
      when the truncated cyclase was expressed from the bla promoter. We conclude that 
      transcriptional regulation of cya does indeed play a role in the down-regulation 
      of cAMP production by CRP, although the major regulation is exerted at the 
      posttranscriptional level. The C-terminal region comprising the last 48 amino 
      acids of cyclase is responsible for the posttranscriptional regulation. A simple 
      new method for the determination of cAMP is also described.

TI  - Transcriptional control mediated by the ArcA two-component response regulator 
      protein of Escherichia coli: characterization of DNA binding at target promoters.
PG  - 6238-49
AB  - ArcA protein bearing an amino-terminal, oligohistidine extension has been 
      purified, and its DNA binding activity has been characterized with or without 
      prior incubation with carbamoyl phosphate. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays 
      and DNase I protection assays indicate that where the phosphorylated form of the 
      ArcA protein (ArcA-P) is expected to act as a transcriptional repressor (e.g., of 
      lctPRD and gltA-sdhCDAB), the effect is likely to be mediated by sequestration of 
      cis-controlling transcriptional regulatory elements. In contrast, in the case of 
      cydAB, for which ArcA-P is expected to function as a transcriptional activator, 
      two discrete binding sites have been identified upstream of a known promoter, and 
      activation from these sites is likely to be mediated by a mechanism typical of 
      the type I class of prokaryotic transcriptional activators. An additional ArcA-P 
      binding site has also been located downstream of the known promoter, and a 
      distinct role for this site in the regulation of the cydAB operon during anoxic 
      growth transitions is suggested. These results are discussed within the framework 
      of an overall model of signaling by the Arc two-component signal transduction 
      system in response to changes in aerobiosis.

TI  - Regulation of HU alpha and HU beta by CRP and FIS in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 126-39
AB  - The dimeric histone-like protein HU, one of the most abundant DNA binding 
      proteins of Escherichia coli, is encoded by two closely related but unlinked 
      genes, hupA and hupB. Overproduction of one or the other of the subunits has been 
      shown to induce the SOS response and mucoidy. To understand how the synthesis of 
      this protein is coordinated, we studied the transcription control of the two hup 
      genes. We show here that CRP stimulated the transcription of both genes. In 
      contrast, the FIS protein, one of the major positive regulators of the stable RNA 
      operons, stimulated the transcription of the hupA gene, whereas it repressed that 
      of the hupB gene. Moreover, stringent control, which like FIS also regulates the 
      transcription of the stable RNA operons, affected the hupB transcription while it 
      had no effect on hupA. This opposite regulation of the transcription of the two 
      HU genes is reflected at the protein level signifying that changes in the 
      composition of HU occur upon changes in the environment. It is rather unexpected 
      that such divergent transcriptional regulation controls the two genes encoding a 
      dimeric protein.

TI  - Influence of DNA geometry on transcriptional activation in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5449-58
AB  - Transcription from many Escherichia coli promoters can be activated by the 
      cAMP-CRP complex bound at different locations upstream of the promoter. At some 
      locations the mechanism of activation involves direct protein-protein contacts 
      between CRP and the RNA polymerase. We positioned the CRP binding site at various 
      distances from the transcription start site of the malT promoter and measured the 
      in vivo activities of these promoter variants. From the activation profiles we 
      deduce that the protein-protein interactions involved in transcriptional 
      activation are rather rigid. A heterologous protein (IHF) that bends the DNA to a 
      similar degree as does CRP activates transcription when bound at sites equivalent 
      to activating positions for CRP. DNA geometry makes a major contribution to the 
      process of transcriptional activation and DNA upstream of the activator binding 
      site participates in this process. Removal of this DNA decreases the capacity of 
      the malT promoter to be activated by CRP in vitro. We conclude that both DNA 
      topology and direct protein-protein contacts contribute to transcriptional 
      activation and that the relative importance of these two modes of activation 
      depends on the nature of the activator and on the location of the activator 
      binding site.

      of the protein-DNA interface.
PG  - 395-408
AB  - The crystallographic structure of the CAP-DNA complex at 3.0 A resolution has 
      been reported previously. For technical reasons, the reported structure had been 
      determined using a gapped DNA molecule lacking two phosphates important for 
      CAP-DNA interaction. In this work, we report the crystallographic structure of 
      the CAP-DNA complex at 2.5 A resolution using a DNA molecule having all 
      phosphates important for CAP-DNA interaction. The present resolution permits 
      unambiguous identification of amino acid-base and amino acid-phosphate hydrogen 
      bonded contacts in the CAP-DNA complex. In addition, the present resolution 
      permits accurate definition of the kinked DNA conformation in the CAP-DNA 
      complex.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the Escherichia coli rhaT gene.
PG  - 1833-40
AB  - Transcriptional regulation of the rhaT gene, one of the operons forming the 
      rhamnose regulon in Escherichia coli, was studied by fusing its complete or 
      deleted promoter to the reporter gene lacZ. Analysis of beta-galactosidase 
      activities induced in these constructions grown under different conditions 
      predicted the presence of two putative control elements: one for the RhaS 
      regulatory protein and activating the gene not only by L-rhamnose but also by 
      L-lyxose or L-mannose, the other for cAMP-catabolite repression protein and 
      activating this gene in the absence of glucose. Anaerobiosis increased the 
      promoter function two- to threefold with respect to the aerobic condition. 
      Experiments involving complementation of strains containing the rhaT-promoter 
      fusion and carrying a deletion in the rhaS and/or rhaR genes with plasmids 
      bearing the rhamnose regulatory genes showed that rhaT is controlled by a 
      regulatory cascade, in which RhaR induces rhaSR and the accumulated RhaS directly 
      activates rhaT.

TI  - Cyclic AMP receptor protein positively controls gyrA transcription and alters DNA 
      topology after nutritional upshift in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 3331-4
AB  - The expression of a transcriptional gyrA-lacZ gene fusion throughout the 
      Escherichia coli growth cycle and the effect that mutation delta crp39 had on 
      this expression were studied. The data obtained indicate that the expression of 
      gyrA is growth phase dependent and under the positive control of the cyclic AMP 
      receptor protein (CRP). Complementation analysis of gyrA-lacZ expression with 
      wild-type CRP or variant CRP pc (with a T-to-A mutation at position 158) in a 
      CRP-deficient background suggests that this CRP action is mediated by a class I 
      or class II CRP-dependent promoter(s). Our results also indicate that CRP may be 
      involved in the modulation of DNA topology in the transition from the lag period 
      to the exponential phase of growth.

TI  - Cloning and molecular genetic characterization of the Escherichia coli gntR, 
      gntK, and gntU genes of GntI, the main system for gluconate metabolism.
PG  - 3260-9
AB  - Three genes involved in gluconate metabolism, gntR, gntK, and gntU, which code 
      for a regulatory protein, a gluconate kinase, and a gluconate transporter, 
      respectively, were cloned from Escherichia coli K-12 on the basis of their known 
      locations on the genomic restriction map. The gene order is gntU, gntK, and gntR, 
      which are immediately adjacent to asd at 77.0 min, and all three genes are 
      transcribed in the counterclockwise direction. The gntR product is 331 amino 
      acids long, with a helix-turn-helix motif typical of a regulatory protein. The 
      gntK gene encodes a 175-amino-acid polypeptide that has an ATP-binding motif 
      similar to those found in other sugar kinases. While GntK does not show 
      significant sequence similarity to any known sugar kinases, it is 45% identical 
      to a second putative gluconate kinase from E. coli,gntV. The 445-amino-acid 
      sequence encoded by gntU has a secondary structure typical of membrane-spanning 
      transport proteins and is 37% identical to the gntP product from Bacillus 
      subtilis. Kinetic analysis of GntU indicates an apparent Km for gluconate of 212 
      microM, indicating that this is a low-affinity transporter. Studies demonstrate 
      that the gntR gene is monocistronic, while the gntU and gntK genes, which are 
      separated by only 3 bp, form an operon. Expression of gntR is essentially 
      constitutive, while expression of gntKU is induced by gluconate and is subject to 
      fourfold glucose catabolite repression. These results confirm that gntK and gntU, 
      together with another gluconate transport gene, gntT, constitute the GntI system 
      for gluconate utilization, under control of the gntR gene product, which is also 
      responsible for induction of the edd and eda genes of the Entner-Doudoroff 
      pathway.

PG  - 177-80
AB  - We have identified 6 Escherichia coli genomic genes, including 4 new genes, 
      responsive to the stationary phase. One of them was regulated positively by RpoS 
      at the stationary phase, and the remaining 5 negatively at a late stationary 
      phase, all of them responding to multiple environmental stresses. Nucleotide 
      sequences as well as such multiple responses revealed that those genes may have 
      more than one overlapping-promoter recognized by different sigma-factors which 
      regulate gene expressions during their cell growth.

TI  - A flexible partnership: the CytR anti-activator and the cAMP-CRP activator 
      protein, comrades in transcription control.
PG  - 461-6
AB  - A vital point in gene regulation is control at the level of transcription 
      initiation. Recent research has established that this regulation can involve 
      sophisticated networks of interacting proteins that modulate the activity of the 
      transcription machinery by DNA looping, direct protein-protein interactions or 
      changing DNA topology in the promoter region. This Micro-Review focuses on our 
      investigations of a relatively simple prokaryotic gene regulatory system, the 
      Escherichia coli CytR regulon, which exhibits a number of these features. This 
      work has opened the door to the molecular understanding of how a prokaryotic 
      repressor can be correctly positioned at specific DNA sequences with the help of 
      a global activator, and how the repressor subsequently inhibits factor-dependent 
      transcription initiation.

TI  - maoB, a gene that encodes a positive regulator of the monoamine oxidase gene 
      (maoA) in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 2941-7
AB  - The structural gene for copper- and topa quinone-containing monoamine oxidase 
      (maoA) and an unknown amine oxidase gene have been located at 30.9 min on the 
      Escherichia coli chromosome. Deletion analysis showed that the unknown gene was 
      located within a 1.1-kb cloned fragment adjacent to the maoA gene. The nucleotide 
      sequence of this fragment was determined, and a single open reading frame (maoB) 
      consisting of 903 bp was found. The gene encoded a polypeptide with a predicted 
      molecular mass of 34,619 Da which was correlated with the migration on a sodium 
      dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. The predicted amino acid sequence of the MaoB 
      protein was identical to the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence derived by Edman 
      degradation of the protein synthesized under the self-promoter. No homology of 
      the nucleotide sequence of maoB to the sequences of any reported genes was found. 
      However, the amino acid sequence of MaoB showed a high level of homology with 
      respect to the helix-turn-helix motif of the AraC family in its C terminus. The 
      homology search and disruption of maoA on the chromosome led to the conclusion 
      that MaoB is a transcriptional activator of maoA but not an amine oxidase. The 
      consensus sequence of the cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP receptor protein complex binding 
      domain was adjacent to the putative promoter for the maoB gene. By use of lac 
      gene fusions with the maoA and maoB genes, we showed that the maoA gene is 
      regulated by tyramine and MaoB and that the expression of the maoB gene is 
      subject to catabolite repression. Thus, it seems likely that tyramine and the 
      MaoB protein activate the transcription of maoA by binding to the regulatory 
      region of the maoA gene.

TI  - Protein-protein interactions during transcription activation: the case of the 
      Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein.
PG  - 543-50
AB  - The Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is a homodimeric 
      transcription activator triggered by cyclic AMP. Escherichia coli contains more 
      than 100 different promoters that can be activated by CRP: in most cases the CRP 
      acts by making direct contact with RNA polymerase. Remarkably, there is 
      considerable variation in the location of the DNA site for CRP from one 
      CRP-dependent promoter to another. Genetic methods have been used to locate the 
      activating regions of CRP that make contact with RNA polymerase at promoters of 
      different architectures. At promoters where the DNA site for CRP is centred near 
      to positions -61, -71 or -81 (i.e. 61, 71 or 81 base pairs upstream of the 
      transcript start-point, respectively), a single surface-exposed loop (Activating 
      Region 1) in the downstream subunit of the CRP dimer makes contact with RNA 
      polymerase. The contact site in RNA polymerase is located in one of the 
      C-terminal domains of two RNA polymerase alpha subunits. At promoters where the 
      DNA site for CRP is centred near to position-41, both subunits of the CRP dimer 
      make contact with RNA polymerase via three separate surface exposed regions 
      (Activating Regions 1, 2 and 3). At these promoters, where bound CRP overlaps 
      with RNA polymerase-binding elements, the C-terminal domains of the polymerase 
      alpha subunits are displaced and bind upstream of CRP. Activation at a number of 
      E. coli promoters is dependent on binding of two CRP dimers, with one dimer bound 
      near to position-41 and the other dimer bound further upstream. In these cases, 
      both bound CRP dimers contact RNA polymerase. The CRP dimer bound around 
      position-41 contacts RNA polymerase via Activating Regions 1, 2 and 3, whereas 
      the upstream bound CRP dimer contacts one of the displaced alpha C-terminal 
      domains via Activating Region 1 in the downstream CRP subunit. Thus in these 
      cases, codependence on two activators is due to simultaneous contacts between 
      separate activators and RNA polymerase. This mechanism allows great flexibility, 
      as any activator that can contact the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase 
      alpha subunits can act cooperatively with CRP.

TI  - Orientation of functional activating regions in the Escherichia coli CRP protein 
      during transcription activation at class II promoters.
PG  - 1112-8
AB  - At class II CRP-dependent promoters the DNA site for CRP overlaps the DNA site 
      for RNA polymerase, covering the -35 region. Transcription activation at class II 
      CRP- dependent promoters requires a contact between an activating region in the 
      upstream subunit of the bound CRP dimer and a contact site in the C-terminal 
      domain of the alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase. Transcription activation is 
      suppressed by amino acid substitutions in the activating region, but activation 
      can be restored by second site substitutions at K52 or E96. These substitutions 
      identify two separate regions on the surface of CRP that appear to be able to 
      interact with RNA polymerase specifically at class II promoters. Using the method 
      of 'oriented heterodimers' we show that these alternative activating regions are 
      functional in the downstream subunit of the bound CRP dimer.

TI  - Identification and characterization of the caiF gene encoding a potential 
      transcriptional activator of carnitine metabolism in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1248-57
AB  - Expression of the Escherichia coli caiTABCDE and fixABCX operons involved in 
      carnitine metabolism is induced by both carnitine and anaerobiosis. When cloned 
      into a multicopy plasmid, the 3' region adjacent to the caiTABCDE operon was 
      found to increase levels of carnitine dehydratase activity synthesized from the 
      chromosomal caiB gene. The nucleotide sequence was determined, and it was shown 
      to contain an open reading frame of 393 bp named caiF which is transcribed in the 
      direction opposite that of the cai operon. This open reading frame encodes a 
      protein of 131 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 15,438 Da which 
      does not have any significant homology with proteins available in data libraries. 
      In vivo overexpression consistently led to the synthesis of a 16-kDa protein. The 
      caiF gene was transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA under anaerobiosis 
      independently of the presence of carnitine. Primer extension analysis located the 
      start site of transcription to position 82 upstream of the caiF initiation codon. 
      It was preceded by a cyclic AMP receptor protein motif centered at position 
      -41.5. Overproduction of CaiF resulted in the stimulation of transcription of the 
      divergent cai and fix operons in the presence of carnitine. This suggested that 
      CaiF by interacting with carnitine plays the role of an activator, thereby 
      mediating induction of carnitine metabolism. Moreover, CaiF could complement in 
      trans the regulatory defect of laboratory strain MC4100 impaired in the carnitine 
      pathway. Expression of a caiF-lacZ operon fusion was subject to FNR 
      regulator-mediated anaerobic induction and cyclic AMP receptor protein 
      activation. The histone-like protein H-NS and the NarL (plus nitrate) regulator 
      acted as repressors. Because of the multiple controls to which the caiF gene is 
      subjected, it appears to be a key element in the regulation of carnitine 
      metabolism.

TI  - Analysis of CRP-CytR interactions at the Escherichia coli udp promoter.
PG  - 1614-22
AB  - Multiprotein complexes regulate the transcription of certain bacterial genes in a 
      sensitive, physiologically responsive manner. In particular, the transcription of 
      genes needed for utilization of nucleosides in Escherichia coli is regulated by a 
      repressor protein, CytR, in concert with the cyclic AMP (cAMP) activated form of 
      cAMP receptor protein (CRP). We studied this regulation by selecting and 
      characterizing spontaneous constitutive mutations in the promoter of the udp 
      (uridine phosphorylase) gene, one of the genes most strongly regulated by CytR. 
      We found deletions, duplications, and point mutations that affect key regulatory 
      sites in the udp promoter, insertion sequence element insertions that activated 
      cryptic internal promoters or provided new promoters, and large duplications that 
      may have increased expression by udp gene amplification. Unusual duplications and 
      deletions that resulted in constitutive udp expression that depended on the 
      presence of CytR were also found. Our results support the model in which 
      repression normally involves the binding of CytR to cAMP-CRP to form a complex 
      which binds to specific sites in the udp promoter, without direct interaction 
      between CytR protein and a specific operator DNA sequence, and in which induction 
      by specific inducer cytidine involves dissociation of CytR from cAMP-CRP and the 
      RNA polymerase interaction with cAMP-CRP bound to a site upstream of then 
      transcription start point. The stimulation of udp expression by CytR in certain 
      mutants may reflect its stabilization of cAMP-CRP binding to target DNA and 
      illustrates that only modest evolutionary changes could allow particular 
      multiprotein complexes to serve as either repressors or transcriptional 
      activators.

TI  - Evolution of transcriptional regulation system through promiscuous coupling of 
      regulatory proteins with operons; suggestion from protein sequence similarities 
      in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 183-204
AB  - As an advanced molecular study of the problems of the evolution of organisms, the 
      transcriptional regulation system is studied by investigating the amino acid 
      sequence similarities between the proteins in the regulation system of 
      Escherichia coli in which the data of sequenced proteins as well as of 
      regulator-regulon relationships are accumulated. The similarities between the 
      proteins are calculated by the FASTA algorithm and their homology is also 
      evaluated in terms of statistical significance with the use of the RDF2 program. 
      This investigation reveals that the similarity between the regulatory protein and 
      the regulated protein is hardly found, but many similarities are found between 
      regulatory proteins and between regulated proteins. These similarity relations 
      are compared with the regulator-regulon relationships ascertained experimentally. 
      From this comparison, it is found that similar regulatory proteins rarely 
      regulate the transcription of similar protein genes. As most of the highly 
      similar proteins are considered to have diverged from a common ancestral protein, 
      this finding strongly suggests the possibility that descendant regulatory 
      proteins have been promiscuously coupled with descendant operons, independently 
      of their ancestral regulator-regulon relationship, and that some of the couplings 
      have been fixed by selection to form the present system of transcriptional 
      regulation. The compatibility of such promiscuous coupling with regulatory 
      organization is illustrated in the carbohydrate transport systems and the 
      succeeding metabolic pathways, whose organization is comprehensive in sending 
      nutritious substances to the central path of glycolysis under different 
      environmental conditions. The benefit of flexibility in regulator-regulon 
      relationships in evolutionary processes is also discussed in connection with the 
      punctuational divergence of species in macroevolution and the cell 
      differentiation in multicellular organisms.

TI  - The gntP gene of Escherichia coli involved in gluconate uptake.
PG  - 61-7
AB  - The gntP gene, located between the fim and uxu loci in Escherichia coli K-12, has 
      been cloned and characterized. Nucleotide sequencing of a region encompassing the 
      gntP gene revealed an open reading frame of 447 codons with significant homology 
      to the Bacillus subtilis gluconate permease. Northern (RNA) blotting indicated 
      that the gntP gene was monocistronic and was transcribed as an mRNA with an 
      apparent molecular size of 1.54 kb. The transcriptional start point was 
      determined by primer extension analysis. The gntP gene was found to be under 
      catabolite repression and was not induced by gluconate. Also, expression seemed 
      to be stringently controlled. Several observations indicated that the GntP 
      protein is an inner membrane protein; it contains characteristic 
      membrane-spanning regions and was isolated predominantly from the inner-membrane 
      fraction of fractionated host cells. A topology analysis predicted a protein with 
      14 membrane-spanning segments. The inability of a mutant strain to grow on 
      gluconate minimal medium could be relieved by introduction of a plasmid encoding 
      the gntP gene. Finally, the kinetics of GntP-mediated gluconate uptake were 
      investigated, indicating an apparent Km for gluconate of 25 microM.

TI  - Organization and transcriptional regulation of the Escherichia coli K-12 D-serine 
      tolerance locus.
PG  - 6456-61
AB  - We have reinvestigated the genetic organization and the transcription regulation 
      of the dsd operon of Escherichia coli. By combining genetic and biochemical 
      studies, it is demonstrated that the regulatory region of the operon and the gene 
      encoding the specific regulator of D-serine tolerance (dsdC) had been misplaced 
      in previous work on the dsd system. Also, the previous erroneous DNA sequence of 
      the dsdC gene has been corrected. It turned out that an additional gene (dsdX) is 
      present immediately upstream of dsdA (encoding D-serine deaminase) and that dsdC 
      is located adjacent to dsdX. The dsdXA genes are cotranscribed from a common 
      promoter region present in the dsdX-dsdC intercistronic region. The DsdC 
      activator belongs to the LysR-type of transcriptional regulators and is 
      absolutely required for dsdA expression. Additionally, the activity of the dsdXA 
      promoter depends on the cyclic AMP receptor protein, and the two activators act 
      in concert to synergistically activate transcription.

TI  - sbmC, a stationary-phase induced SOS Escherichia coli gene, whose product 
      protects cells from the DNA replication inhibitor microcin B17.
PG  - 301-11
AB  - Microcin B17 (MccB17) is a ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotic of 43 amino 
      acids that induces double-strand breaking of DNA in a DNA gyrase-dependent 
      reaction. As a consequence, the SOS regulon is induced and massive DNA 
      degradation occurs. In this work we have characterized an Escherichia coli gene, 
      sbmC, that in high copy number determines high cell resistance to MccB17. sbmC 
      encodes a cytoplasmic polypeptide of 157 amino acids (M(r), 18,095) that has been 
      visualized in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gene is located at min 44 of the E. 
      coli genetic map, close to the sbcB gene. sbmC expression is induced by 
      DNA-damaging agents and, also, by the entry of cells into the stationary growth 
      phase. A G-->T transversion at the fifth nucleotide of the quasicanonical 
      LexA-box preceding the gene makes recA cells 16-fold more resistant to exogenous 
      MccB17. The gene product, SbmC, also blocks MccB17 export from producing cells. 
      Altogether, our results suggest that SbmC recognizes and sequesters MccB17 in a 
      reversible way.

TI  - Regulatory characteristics and promoter analysis of csiE, a stationary 
      phase-inducible gene under the control of sigma S and the cAMP-CRP complex in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 175-84
AB  - Sigma-S and the cAMP-CRP complex are global regulatory factors involved in 
      stationary-phase induction of large groups of genes in Escherichia coli. csiE, a 
      gene located at 57.25 min (co-ordinate 2674) of the physical map of the E. coli 
      chromosome, is under the control of both of these factors. Sigma-S plays a 
      positive, though not absolutely essential, role in the expression of csiE. 
      Regulation by cAMP-CRP has both positive and negative elements, with the latter 
      being dependent on the presence of sigma s, whose expression is negatively 
      influenced by cAMP-CRP. csiE has a single transcriptional start site located 33 
      bp upstream of the initiation codon. By a 5'-deletion approach, we show that 72 
      bp upstream of the csiE transcriptional start site are sufficient for regulation 
      by sigma s and cAMP-CRP. A deletion upstream of nucleotide -38 with respect to 
      the start site eliminates positive cAMP-CRP control and makes the remaining 
      expression fully dependent on sigma S. Our results indicate that transcription at 
      the csiE promoter can be initiated in vivo by sigma S-containing RNA polymerase 
      alone as well as by sigma 70-containing RNA polymerase in conjunction with 
      cAMP-CRP or a cAMP-CRP-dependent secondary regulator. The promoter region of 
      poxB, the structural gene for pyruvate oxidase, which is also under the control 
      of sigma S and cAMP-CRP, is very similar to the corresponding region of csiE, 
      suggesting a similar regulatory mechanism also for poxB.

TI  - Gene-regulatory modules in Escherichia coli: nucleoprotein complexes formed by 
      cAMP-CRP and CytR at the nupG promoter.
PG  - 843-53
AB  - Repression by CytR depends on the formation of nucleoprotein complexes in which 
      the CytR repressor and the cAMP-CRP activator complex bind co-operatively to the 
      DNA. Transcription initiation from CytR-regulated promoters requires cAMP-CRP; 
      therefore, the cAMP-CRP complex functions both as an activator and as a 
      co-repressor in these promoters. Another interesting aspect of the CytR regulon 
      is that each promoter appears to have individual features. Therefore, structural 
      and functional rules governing the formation of repression and activation 
      complexes in one promoter may not be valid for other promoters of the CytR 
      regulon. Here we show that the Escherichia coli nupG gene contains one CytR- and 
      four CRP-binding sites in the control region. Notably, the architecture of the 
      CytR binding site is different from previously described targets. In addition, 
      the CytR repressor triggers a DNA repositioning of a cAMP-CRP complex in the -35 
      region upon binding to its operator. Thus, formation of the repression and 
      activation complexes at the nupG promoter involves different subsets of 
      CRP-binding sites. These findings show that the bacterium uses positive and 
      negative regulatory modules to differentially control the expression of CytR- and 
      cAMP-CRP-regulated genes.

TI  - Fis activates the RpoS-dependent stationary-phase expression of proP in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5222-31
AB  - Fis is a general nucleoid-associated protein in Escherichia coli whose expression 
      is highly regulated with respect to growth conditions. A random collection of 
      transposon-induced lac fusions was screened for those which give increased 
      expression in the presence of Fis in order to isolate a ProP-LacZ protein fusion. 
      We find that proP, which encodes a low-affinity transporter of the important 
      osmoprotectants proline and glycine betaine, is transcribed from two promoters. 
      proP1 is transiently induced upon subculture and is upregulated by increases in 
      medium osmolarity. As cells enter stationary phase, a second promoter, proP2, is 
      strongly induced. This promoter can also be induced by high medium osmolarity in 
      exponential phase. The activity of proP2 depends on Fis and the stationary-phase 
      sigma factor sigmas. In the presence of Fis, proP2 expression is increased over 
      50-fold, as judged by the LacZ activity of cells carrying the proP-lacZ fusion as 
      well as by direct RNA analysis, making this the most strongly activated promoter 
      by Fis that has been described. Two Fis binding sites centered at positions -41 
      (site I) and -81 (site II) with respect to the transcription initiation site of 
      P2 have been defined by DNase I footprinting. Mutations in site I largely abolish 
      stationary-phase activation, while mutations at site II have a minor effect, 
      suggesting that direct binding of Fis to site I is important for Fis-mediated 
      activation of this promoter. In addition to Fis and sigmas, sequences located 
      over 108 bp upstream of the proP2 transcription initiation site are required for 
      efficient expression.

PG  - 1901-1907
LID - 10.1099/13500872-141-8-1901 [doi]
AB  - The control region of the mannitol (mtl) operon of Escherichia coli has been 
      shown to contain five cAMP receptor protein (CRP) binding sequences, the most yet 
      reported for any operon. A DNA fragment encompassing the entire mtl operon 
      regulatory region was generated by PCR, and the binding of the cAMP-CRP complex 
      was studied. Using restrictional analysis to separate, delineate and destroy the 
      various putative CRP binding sites, all five sites were shown to be functional 
      for CRP binding in vitro. Four of these sites bound the cAMP-CRP complex with 
      high affinity while the fifth site (the most distal relative to the 
      transcriptional start site) bound the complex with lower affinity. Simultaneous 
      binding of cAMP-CRP complexes to several of these sites was demonstrated. The 
      results serve to identify and define five dissimilar CRP binding sites in a 
      single operon of E. coli. A model for mtl operon transcriptional initiation and 
      repression complexes is presented.

TI  - Molecular analysis of treB encoding the Escherichia coli enzyme II specific for 
      trehalose.
PG  - 4043-52
AB  - A gene bank of partially Sau3A-digested Escherichia coli DNA ligated in plasmid 
      pBR322 was screened for the ability to complement a mutant unable to metabolize 
      trehalose at low osmolarity. The resulting plasmid was shown to contain the genes 
      encoding transport (treB) and metabolic (treC) functions. The complementing DNA 
      region was sequenced and shown to contain an operon of two genes, with treB as 
      the promoter proximal gene and with treC as the promoter distal gene. The 
      transcriptional start point was determined, and one major transcript was 
      detected. The control region of the operon was found to contain consensus binding 
      motifs for the cyclic AMP-catabolite activator protein complex and for a specific 
      repressor protein whose gene, treR, is located immediately upstream of treB, 
      being transcribed in the same direction as treB treC. The products of both genes 
      could be expressed in minicells in which TreB revealed itself as a protein with 
      an apparent molecular weight of 42,000. The gene product of treB consists of 485 
      amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 52,308. It showed high homology 
      to enzymes IIScr of enteric bacteria specific for the uptake of sucrose and 
      encoded by plasmid pUR400 of enteric bacteria. Like enzyme IIScr, enzyme IITre 
      belongs to the EIIBC domain type and lacks a covalently bound EIIA domain. 
      Instead, enzyme IITre-mediated phosphorylation of trehalose requires the activity 
      of enzyme IIAGlc, a component of the major glucose transport system.

TI  - aldB, an RpoS-dependent gene in Escherichia coli encoding an aldehyde 
      dehydrogenase that is repressed by Fis and activated by Crp.
PG  - 3166-75
AB  - Escherichia coli aldB was identified as a gene that is negatively regulated by 
      Fis but positively regulated by RpoS. The complete DNA sequence determined in 
      this study indicates that aldB encodes a 56.3-kDa protein which shares a high 
      degree of homology with an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase encoded by acoD of 
      Alcaligenes eutrophus and an aldehyde dehydrogenase encoded by aldA of Vibrio 
      cholerae and significant homology with a group of other aldehyde dehydrogenases 
      from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Expression of aldB is maximally induced during 
      the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase. Its message levels are 
      elevated three- to fourfold by a fis mutation and abolished by an rpoS mutation. 
      In addition, the expression of an aldB-lacZ fusion was decreased about 20-fold in 
      the absence of crp. DNase I footprinting analysis showed that five Fis binding 
      sites and one Crp binding site are located within the aldB promoter region, 
      suggesting that Fis and Crp are acting directly to control aldB transcription. 
      AldB expression is induced by ethanol, but in contrast to that of most of the 
      RpoS-dependent genes, the expression of aldB is not altered by an increase in 
      medium osmolarity.

TI  - Transcription activation at the Escherichia coli uhpT promoter by the catabolite 
      gene activator protein.
PG  - 1712-8
AB  - Transport and utilization of sugar phosphates in Escherichia coli depend on the 
      transport protein encoded by the uhpT gene. Transmembrane induction of uhpT 
      expression by external glucose 6-phosphate is positively regulated by the 
      promoter-specific activator protein UhpA and the global regulator catabolite gene 
      activator protein (CAP). Activation by UhpA requires a promoter element centered 
      at -64 bp, relative to the start of transcription, and activation by CAP requires 
      a DNA site centered at position -103.5. This DNA site binds the cyclic AMP-CAP 
      complex in vitro, and its deletion from the promoter reduces transcription 
      activity to 7 to 9% of the wild-type level. Ten uhpT promoter derivatives with 
      altered spacing between the DNA site for CAP and the remainder of the promoter 
      were constructed. Their transcription activities indicated that the action of CAP 
      at this promoter is dependent on proper helical phasing of promoter elements, 
      with CAP binding on the same face of the helix as RNA polymerase does. Five CAP 
      mutants defective in transcription activation at class I and class II 
      CAP-dependent promoters but not defective in DNA binding or DNA bending (positive 
      control mutants) were tested for the ability to activate transcription. These 
      CAPpc mutants exhibited little or no defect in transcription activation at uhpT, 
      indicating that CAP action at uhpTp involves a different mechanism than that 
      which is used for its action at other classes of CAP-dependent promoters.

TI  - Effect of the FruR regulator on transcription of the pts operon in Escherichia 
      coli.
PG  - 2489-96
AB  - The promoters of the pts operon of Escherichia coli are controlled by the cyclic 
      AMP receptor protein (CRP) complexed with cAMP (CRP.cAMP). In addition, glucose 
      stimulates pts operon expression in vivo. The pts promoter region has a fructose 
      repressor (FruR)-binding site (the FruR box) that partially overlaps with one of 
      the CRP.cAMP-binding sites. The effects of the pleiotropic transcriptional 
      regulator FruR on pts operon expression were studied to determine whether the in 
      vivo glucose effect on pts operon expression is mediated by FruR. In vitro, FruR 
      can repress P1b transcription, which is activated by CRP.cAMP, and restore P1a 
      transcription, which is repressed by CRP.cAMP. FruR can displace CRP.cAMP from 
      its binding site in the presence of RNA polymerase even though FruR and CRP.cAMP 
      can bind simultaneously to their partially overlapping binding sites in the 
      absence of RNA polymerase. FruR had very little effect on the transcription of 
      the P0 promoter, which is most important for regulation by glucose. Consistent 
      with the in vitro results, pts P0 transcription did not increase as much in cells 
      grown in the presence of fructose or in fruR- mutant cells as in cells grown in 
      the presence of glucose. These results suggest that FruR alone does not mediate 
      the in vivo glucose effect on pts operon expression.

TI  - The gene encoding the periplasmic cyclophilin homologue, PPIase A, in Escherichia 
      coli, is expressed from four promoters, three of which are activated by the 
      cAMP-CRP complex and negatively regulated by the CytR repressor.
PG  - 989-97
AB  - The rot gene in Escherichia coli encodes PPIase A, a periplasmic peptidyl-prolyl 
      cis-trans isomerase with homology to the cyclophilin family of proteins. Here it 
      is demonstrated that rot is expressed in a complex manner from four overlapping 
      promoters and that the rot regulatory region is unusually compact, containing a 
      close array of sites for DNA-binding proteins. The three most upstream rot 
      promoters are activated by the global gene regulatory cAMP-CRP complex and 
      negatively regulated by the CytR repressor protein. Activation of these three 
      promoters occurs by binding of cAMP-CRP to two sites separated by 53 bp. 
      Moreover, one of the cAMP-CRP complexes is involved in the activation of both a 
      Class I and a Class II promoter. Repression takes place by the formation of a 
      CytR/cAMP-CRP/DNA nucleoprotein complex consisting of the two cAMP-CRP molecules 
      and CytR bound in between. The two regulators bind co-operatively to the DNA 
      overlapping the three upstream promoters, simultaneously quenching the cAMP-CRP 
      activator function. These results expand the CytR regulon to include a gene whose 
      product has no known function in ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside catabolism or 
      transport.

TI  - DNA-dependent renaturation of an insoluble DNA binding protein. Identification of 
      the RhaS binding site at rhaBAD.
PG  - 821-9
AB  - Previous work has indicated that the RhaS protein directly activates the 
      L-rhamnose catabolic operon, rhaBAD, and that the likely RhaS binding site lies 
      downstream of position -84 relative to the rhaBAD transcription start point. 
      Biochemical analysis of RhaS binding to this DNA site had not been possible due 
      to the extreme insolubility of overproduced RhaS protein. Here we have been able 
      to analyze directly the DNA binding properties of RhaS by developing a method to 
      refold insoluble RhaS protein into a form with specific DNA binding activity. We 
      found that active RhaS protein could be recovered only if the renaturation 
      reaction was performed in the presence of DNA. We also found that the recovery of 
      DNA-binding activity from the related AraC protein, after denaturation in urea, 
      was dependent upon added DNA. To test the specificity of the recovered RhaS 
      DNA-binding activity, and to define the binding site for comparison with other 
      AraC family binding sites, we then investigated the details of the RhaS binding 
      site. Using refolded RhaS protein in a DNase footprinting assay, we found that 
      RhaS protects a region of the rhaBAD promoter from position -83 to -28. Analysis 
      of the effects of single base mutations in the rhaBAD promoter region indicates 
      that RhaS binds to an inverted repeat of two 17 bp half-sites separated by 16 bp, 
      located between -81 and -32 relative to the rhaBAD transcription start site.

TI  - Characterization of the activating region of Escherichia coli catabolite gene 
      activator protein (CAP). I. Saturation and alanine-scanning mutagenesis.
PG  - 595-602
AB  - It has been proposed that the surface loop consisting of amino acid residues 152 
      to 166 of the catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) of Escherichia coli makes 
      direct protein-protein contact with RNA polymerase at the lac promoter. In this 
      work, we have used targeted saturation mutagenesis of codons 152 to 166 of the 
      gene encoding CAP, followed by a screen, to isolate more than 200 independent 
      mutants of CAP defective in transcription activation but not defective in DNA 
      binding. All isolated single-substitution mutants map to just eight amino acid 
      residues; 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 162, 163 and 164. We propose that these 
      residues define the full extent of the epitope on CAP for the proposed CAP-RNA 
      polymerase interaction. In addition, we have constructed alanine substitutions at 
      each position from residue 152 to 166 of CAP, and we have analyzed the effects on 
      transcription activation at the lac promoter and on DNA binding. Alanine 
      substitution of Thr158 results in an approximately eightfold specific defect in 
      transcription activation. In contrast, alanine substitution of no other residue 
      tested results in a more than twofold specific defect in transcription 
      activation. We conclude that, for Thr158, side-chain atoms beyond C beta are 
      essential for transcription activation at the lac promoter, and we propose that 
      Thr158 OH7 gamma makes direct contact with RNA polymerase in the ternary complex 
      of lac promoter, CAP and RNA polymerase. We conclude further that for no residue 
      other than Thr158 are side-chain atoms beyond C beta essential for transcription 
      activation at the lac promoter.

TI  - The functional subunit of a dimeric transcription activator protein depends on 
      promoter architecture.
PG  - 4549-57
AB  - In Class I CAP-dependent promoters, the DNA site for CAP is located upstream of 
      the DNA site for RNA polymerase. In Class II CAP-dependent promoters, the DNA 
      site for CAP overlaps the DNA site for RNA polymerase, replacing the -35 site. We 
      have used an 'oriented heterodimers' approach to identify the functional subunit 
      of CAP at two Class I promoters having different distances between the DNA sites 
      for CAP and RNA polymerase [CC(-61.5) and CC(-72.5)] and at one Class II promoter 
      [CC(-41.5)]. Our results indicate that transcription activation at Class I 
      promoters, irrespective of the distance between the DNA sites for CAP and RNA 
      polymerase, requires the activating region of the promoter-proximal subunit of 
      CAP. In striking contrast, our results indicate that transcription activation at 
      Class II promoters requires the activating region of the promoter-distal subunit 
      of CAP.

TI  - Functional analysis of the tdcABC promoter of Escherichia coli: roles of TdcA and 
      TdcR.
PG  - 6214-20
AB  - The efficient expression of the tdc operon of Escherichia coli requires the 
      products of two regulatory genes, tdcR and tdcA. We have identified the 
      transcription site of tdcR by primer extension mapping and established the 
      translation start site of TdcR by mutational analysis of its reading frame. In a 
      tdcR tdcABC deletion strain, tdcR+ promoted high-level LacZ expression from a 
      lambda tdcAB-lacZ lysogen and mutations introduced in tdcR resulted in a greater 
      than sixfold decrease in LacZ level. In-frame deletions of tdcA also reduced LacZ 
      expression, and chromosomal and plasmid-borne tdcA+ increased the LacZ level in 
      tdcA mutant lysogens. Interestingly, multicopy tdcA+ plasmids introduced into 
      tdcR mutant strains completely restored tdc expression. In separate experiments 
      we found that mutations in the tdc promoter DNA around positions -70, -140, and 
      -175 greatly reduced tdc expression relative to that for the wild-type promoter 
      and the tdcP mutation around -175 prevented multicopy tdcA+ from rescuing tdcR 
      mutants. Furthermore, competition experiments revealed that a wild-type promoter 
      fragment encompassing the -175 region cloned into a plasmid reduced tdc 
      expression by titrating TdcA in vivo, and this effect was reversed with excess 
      TdcA. These results suggest that in tdcR+ cells TdcR interacts with tdcP and/or 
      TdcA to enhance tdc transcription whereas in tdcR mutant cells a new tdcP-TdcA 
      complex around -175 in the native promoter bypasses the requirement for TdcR. On 
      the basis of the accumulated data summarized here and elsewhere we propose that 
      multiple transcription factors enhance tdc operon expression by bending and 
      looping of the promoter DNA to form an active transcription complex.

TI  - Molecular characterization of the cai operon necessary for carnitine metabolism 
      in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 775-86
AB  - The sequence encompassing the cai genes of Escherichia coli, which encode the 
      carnitine pathway, has been determined. Apart from the already identified caiB 
      gene coding for the carnitine dehydratase, five additional open reading frames 
      were identified. They belong to the caiTABCDE operon, which was shown to be 
      located at the first minute on the chromosome and transcribed during anaerobic 
      growth in the presence of carnitine. The activity of carnitine dehydratase was 
      dependent on the CRP regulatory protein and strongly enhanced in the absence of a 
      functional H-NS protein, in relation to the consensus sequences detected in the 
      promoter region of the cai operon. In vivo expression studies led to the 
      synthesis of five polypeptides in addition to CaiB, with predicted molecular 
      masses of 56,613 Da (CaiT), 42,564 Da (CaiA), 59,311 Da (CaiC), 32,329 Da (CaiD) 
      and 21,930 Da (CaiE). Amino acid sequence similarity or enzymatic analysis 
      supported the function assigned to each protein. CaiT was suggested to be the 
      transport system for carnitine or betaines, CaiA an oxidoreduction enzyme, and 
      CaiC a crotonobetaine/carnitine CoA ligase. CaiD bears strong homology with enoyl 
      hydratases/isomerases. Overproduction of CaiE was shown to stimulate the 
      carnitine racemase activity of the CaiD protein and to markedly increase the 
      basal level of carnitine dehydratase activity. It is inferred that CaiE is an 
      enzyme involved in the synthesis or the activation of the still unknown cofactor 
      required for carnitine dehydratase and carnitine racemase activities. Taken 
      together, these data suggest that the carnitine pathway in E. coli resembles that 
      found in a strain situated between Agrobacterium and Rhizobium.

TI  - Mechanism of the down-regulation of cAMP receptor protein by glucose in 
      Escherichia coli: role of autoregulation of the crp gene.
PG  - 3077-82
AB  - Glucose causes catabolite repression by lowering the intracellular levels of both 
      cAMP and cAMP receptor protein (CRP) in Escherichia coli. The molecular mechanism 
      underlying the down-regulation of CRP by glucose has been investigated. We show 
      that glucose lowers the level of crp mRNA without affecting its stability. 
      Replacement of the crp promoter with the bla promoter almost completely abolishes 
      the glucose-mediated regulation of crp expression. Only a slight reduction in the 
      crp expression by glucose is observed in cya- or crp- strains, suggesting that a 
      CRP-cAMP complex is needed for this regulation. We previously showed that 
      transcription of the crp gene is regulated both negatively and positively. 
      Positive autoregulation of crp is caused by the binding of CRP-cAMP to the CRP 
      binding site II located upstream of the crp promoter. Here we show that 
      disrupting the CRP binding site II essentially eliminates the down-regulation of 
      crp expression by glucose. We conclude that the autoregulatory circuit of the crp 
      gene plays a key role in the down-regulation of CRP by glucose.

TI  - Cyclic AMP-dependent expression of the Escherichia coli serC-aroA operon.
PG  - 250-3
AB  - The Escherichia coli serC-aroA operon encodes biosynthetic enzymes for unrelated 
      amino acid biosynthetic pathways leading to the synthesis of serine and the 
      aromatic amino acids. A serC-aroA-lac translational fusion was constructed in the 
      vector pMC1403. Synthesis of beta-galactosidase from the serC-aroA-lac fusion was 
      found to be enhanced in the presence of lactose as the sole carbon source. This 
      enhancement was not observed in strains containing a cya or crp mutant. However, 
      the exogenous addition of cAMP greatly increased the beta-galactosidase synthesis 
      in the cya mutant strain. The serC-aroA mRNA content, analyzed by a dot blot 
      assay, also appeared to increase in the serC+ aroA+ cells after the exogenous 
      addition of cAMP. These findings unambiguously indicate that the expression of 
      the serC-aroA operon is positively controlled by cAMP.

TI  - Structure of the 5' upstream region and the regulation of the rpoS gene of 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 525-31
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the 5' upstream region of the Escherichia coli rpoS 
      gene was determined and analyzed. At least four promoters responsible for rpoS 
      transcription were identified, and designated P1, P2, P3 and P4, P1 being 
      furthest from the upstream. Using lacZ fusion genes, the P2 promoter was found to 
      be the strongest of the four. All of these promoters are regulated similarly, and 
      their activity is enhanced 2 to 3-fold in stationary phase. P1 and P2 
      transcription start sites were determined by primer extension analyses. The P2 
      promoter region shows similarity to the consensus sigma 70-type promoter 
      sequence, and was recognized by both E sigma 70 and E sigma 38 holoenzymes in 
      vitro. The mRNA transcribed from the most distal promoter, P1, appears to include 
      another open reading frame (orf-281), indicating that the two open reading frames 
      comprise an operon. The rpoS gene product (sigma 38) was rapidly degraded after 
      addition of chloramphenicol to cultures in the exponential, but not the 
      stationary phase. This strongly suggests that posttranslational regulation is 
      involved in the control of rpoS expression.

      environmental stimuli.
PG  - 3438-41
AB  - Seven GATC sites that are nonmethylated in logarithmic growth phase cells using 
      glycerol as a carbon source were isolated from the Escherichia coli chromosome. 
      Three of these GATC sites are located upstream of the operons gut, mtl, and ppiA, 
      whereas DNA sequences adjacent to three other nonmethylated GATC sites are not 
      homologous to previously identified genes. The seventh nonmethylated GATC site is 
      located downstream of uspA. The protection of this site from DNA methylation 
      requires leucine-responsive regulatory protein and is leucine responsive. The 
      carbon source and the growth phase influenced the protection of the GATC site 5' 
      of the ppiA gene. The other five sites were protected under all the environmental 
      conditions examined.

TI  - The pdhR-aceEF-lpd operon of Escherichia coli expresses the pyruvate 
      dehydrogenase complex.
PG  - 95-104
AB  - Transcript mapping and studies with lacZ translational fusions have shown that 
      the pdhR gene (formerly genA) is the proximal gene of the pdhR-aceE-aceF-lpd 
      operon encoding the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex of Escherichia coli. A 
      pdhR-lpd read-through transcript (7.4 kb) initiating at the pyruvate-inducible 
      pdh promoter, and a smaller lpd transcript (1.7 kb) initiating at the independent 
      lpd promoter, were identified. Evidence showing that the pdhR gene product 
      negatively regulates the synthesis of the PdhR protein and the PDH complex via 
      the pdh promoter was obtained, with pyruvate (or a derivative) serving as the 
      putative inducing coeffector. The partially purified PdhR protein was also found 
      to specifically retard and protect DNA fragments containing the pdh promoter 
      region. The pdh promoter was not strongly controlled by ArcA, FNR or CRP.

TI  - Expression of the nmpC gene of Escherichia coli K-12 is modulated by external pH. 
      Identification of cis-acting regulatory sequences involved in this regulation.
PG  - 83-93
AB  - Using a set of gene fusions generated with TnphoA, we previously identified the 
      phmA locus, whose expression is modulated as a function of external pH (pHo). The 
      phmA::phoA fusion was cloned and sequenced and the phmA locus was identified with 
      the nmpC gene. This gene lies within the defective lambdoid prophage qsr' and 
      NmpC is an outer membrane protein which functions as a porin. We demonstrated 
      that nmpC is sensitive to catabolite repression and dependent on the CRP-cAMP 
      complex. However, cAMP is not a signal for the pHo-dependent expression of nmpC. 
      By generating step deletions in the sequence 5' to the nmpC coding region, we 
      identified a DNA region in position -345 to -127 which is involved in nmpC 
      repression, mainly during growth at acid pHo. Four regions with strong homologies 
      and a very well-conserved organization of the functional sequence were found in 
      the nmpC and ompF promoters. We propose that the negative regulation of nmpC 
      during growth at low pHo might involve DNA looping of the nmpC promoter.

TI  - Cloning of the nupC gene of Escherichia coli encoding a nucleoside transport 
      system, and identification of an adjacent insertion element, IS 186.
PG  - 1159-68
AB  - Escherichia coli is known to contain more than one active transport system for 
      nucleoside uptake. In the present study we report the sequence of a gene encoding 
      a second nucleoside transport system, nupC (in addition to nupG). An open reading 
      frame (ORF) of 1200 bp was identified that codes for a hydrophobic polypeptide of 
      43,560 Da and an NupC fusion protein was shown to be membrane associated. The 
      native NupC protein is also identified, following over-expression. NupC exhibits 
      short regions of homology to several membrane-associated proteins, including LacY 
      and Cyd. Analysis of the nupC promoter region revealed the presence of at least 
      two putative CRP-binding sites, centred at -40bp and -89bp, which probably flank 
      a CytR-binding site. In addition, an adjacent IS 186 element was identified and 
      found to reside within a putative terminator structure, downstream from the nupC 
      ORF. This arrangement is shown to reflect the previously established gene order 
      on the E. coli chromosome.

TI  - Organization and expression of the Escherichia coli K-12 dad operon encoding the 
      smaller subunit of D-amino acid dehydrogenase and the catabolic alanine racemase.
PG  - 1500-10
AB  - A fragment of the Escherichia coli K-12 chromosome complementing the D-amino acid 
      dehydrogenase and catabolic alanine racemase deficiency of a dad operon deletion 
      mutant was cloned in a mini-Mu plasmid. The dadA and dadX genes were localized to 
      a 3.5-kb part of the plasmid insert. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment 
      revealed two open reading frames encoding 432- and 356-amino-acid-long proteins. 
      We show here that they correspond to the dadA and dadX genes. The dadA gene can 
      encode only the smaller of the two subunits of D-amino acid dehydrogenase. A 
      computer search revealed the presence of a flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding 
      motif in the N-terminal domain of the deduced DadA protein sequence. This is in 
      agreement with biochemical data showing that the D-amino acid dehydrogenase 
      contains flavin adenine dinucleotide in its active center. The predicted dadX 
      gene product appeared to be 85% identical to a dadB-encoded catabolic alanine 
      racemase of Salmonella typhimurium. The organization of the dadA and dadX genes 
      confirmed our previous conclusion based on the genetic data (J. Wild, J. Hennig, 
      M. Lobocka, W. Walczak, and T. Kłopotowski, Mol. Gen. Genet. 198:315-322, 1985) 
      that these genes form an operon. The main transcription start points of the dad 
      operon were determined by primer extension. They are preceded by a putative sigma 
      70 promoter sequence and two cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP receptor protein (cAMP-CRP) 
      binding sites, one of higher and one of lower affinity to CRP. We propose that 
      the high-affinity site, centered 59.5 bp upstream of the main transcription start 
      point, plays a role in cAMP-CRP-mediated activation of dad operon expression in 
      the absence of glucose.

TI  - The Escherichia coli gapA gene is transcribed by the vegetative RNA polymerase 
      holoenzyme E sigma 70 and by the heat shock RNA polymerase E sigma 32.
PG  - 830-9
AB  - Escherichia coli D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is produced 
      by the gapA gene and is structurally related to eukaryotic GAPDHs. These facts 
      led to the proposal that the gapA gene originated by a horizontal transfer of 
      genetic information. The yields and start sites of gapA mRNAs produced in various 
      fermentation conditions and genetic contexts were analyzed by primer extension. 
      The transcriptional regulatory region of the gapA gene was found to contain four 
      promoter sequences, three recognized by the vegetative RNA polymerase E sigma 70 
      and one recognized by the heat shock RNA polymerase E sigma 32. Transcription of 
      gapA by E sigma 32 is activated in the logarithmic phase under conditions of 
      starvation and of heat shock. Using a GAPDH- strain, we found that GAPDH 
      production has a positive effect on cell growth at 43 degrees C. Thus, E. coli 
      GAPDH displays some features of heat shock proteins. One of the gapA promoter 
      sequences transcribed by E sigma 70 is subject to catabolic repression. Another 
      one has growth phase-dependent efficiency. This complex area of differentially 
      regulated promoters allows the production of large amounts of gapA transcripts in 
      a wide variety of environmental conditions. On the basis of these data, the 
      present view of E sigma 32 RNA polymerase function has to be enlarged, and the 
      various hypotheses on E. coli gapA gene origin have to be reexamined.

TI  - Complex transcriptional control of the sigma s-dependent stationary-phase-induced 
      and osmotically regulated osmY (csi-5) gene suggests novel roles for Lrp, cyclic 
      AMP (cAMP) receptor protein-cAMP complex, and integration host factor in the 
      stationary-phase response of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 7910-7
AB  - osmY (csi-5) is a representative of a large group of sigma s-dependent genes in 
      Escherichia coli that exhibit both stationary-phase induction and osmotic 
      regulation. A chromosomal transcriptional lacZ fusion (csi-5::lacZ) was used to 
      study the regulation of osmY. We show here that in addition to sigma s, the 
      global regulators Lrp, cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein-cAMP complex 
      (cAMP-CRP), and integration host factor (IHF) are involved in the control of 
      osmY. All three regulators negatively modulate the expression of osmY, and they 
      act independently from sigma s. Stationary-phase induction of osmY in minimal 
      medium can be explained by stimulation by sigma s combined with a relief of Lrp 
      repression. Stationary-phase induction of osmY in rich medium is mediated by the 
      combined action of sigma s, Lrp, cAMP-CRP, and IHF, with the latter three 
      proteins acting as transition state regulators. The transcriptional start site of 
      osmY was determined and revealed an mRNA with an unusual long nontranslated 
      leader of 244 nucleotides. The regulatory region is characterized by a sigma 
      70-like -10 promoter region and contains potential binding sites for Lrp, CRP, 
      and IHF. Whereas sigma s, Lrp, CRP, and IHF are clearly involved in 
      stationary-phase induction, none of these regulators is essential for osmotic 
      regulation of osmY.

TI  - DNA loop formation between Nag repressor molecules bound to its two operator 
      sites is necessary for repression of the nag regulon of Escherichia coli in vivo.
PG  - 973-81
AB  - Binding sites for the Nag repressor overlap the transcription start sites of the 
      divergent nagE and nagB genes, such that the centres of the sites are separated 
      by nine turns of the B-DNA helix. Mutations which prevent repressor binding to 
      either site or alter the phasing of the binding sites result in simultaneous 
      derepression of both genes. An additional mutation which restores the phasing of 
      the two sites permits repression. These observations show that repression is the 
      result of co-operative binding of the repressor to its two sites, resulting in 
      the formation of a loop of DNA.

TI  - A regulatory cascade in the induction of rhaBAD.
PG  - 87-98
AB  - The RhaS and RhaR regulatory proteins are encoded in the Escherichia coli 
      L-rhamnose gene cluster. We used complementation analysis and DNA mobility shift 
      assays to show that RhaR is not the direct activator of the L-rhamnose catabolic 
      operon, rhaBAD. An in-frame deletion of rhaS (rhaS-rhaR+) eliminated expression 
      from the rhaBAD promoter, pBAD, while overexpression of rhaS greatly speeded the 
      normally slow induction of transcription from pBAD. Expression from pBAD in a 
      coupled transcription-translation assay was only detected when rhaS+ DNA was 
      added to allow synthesis of RhaS protein. RhaS thus appears to be the direct 
      L-rhamnose-specific activator of rhaBAD expression. Deletion mapping located the 
      binding site for the L-rhamnose-specific regulator to a region overlapping 
      position -70 relative to the rhaBAD transcription start site. Deletion mapping 
      and DNA mobility shift assays located a CRP binding site just upstream from the 
      binding site for the L-rhamnose-specific regulator. Quantitative primer extension 
      analysis showed that induction of both the rhaBAD and rhaSR messages was 
      unusually slow, requiring 40 to 50 minutes to reach a steady-state level. 
      Induction of rhaBAD apparently involves a regulatory cascade in which RhaR first 
      induces rhaSR expression, then RhaS accumulates and induces rhaBAD expression.

TI  - Protein-protein interactions in gene regulation: the cAMP-CRP complex sets the 
      specificity of a second DNA-binding protein, the CytR repressor.
PG  - 557-66
AB  - Maximal repression by the CytR protein depends on the formation of nucleoprotein 
      complexes in which CytR interacts with DNA and with cAMP-cAMP receptor protein 
      (CRP). Here we demonstrate that CytR regulates transcription from deoP2 promoters 
      in which the entire CytR recognition sequence has been eliminated. Furthermore, 
      CytR proteins deleted for the DNA-binding domain repress deoP2 in vivo and 
      interact with deoP2 in vitro in a strictly cAMP-CRP-dependent fashion. These 
      experiments show that the site of action of CytR can be specified by 
      protein-protein interactions to cAMP-CRP, whereas CytR-DNA interactions may 
      primarily serve to stabilize the nucleo-protein complex. This type of specificity 
      mechanism may represent a general concept in the recruitment of DNA-binding 
      proteins in combinatorial regulatory systems.

TI  - The galactose regulon of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 245-51
AB  - Galactose transport and metabolism in Escherichia coli involves a multicomponent 
      amphibolic pathway. Galactose transport is accomplished by two different 
      galactose-specific transport systems. At least four of the genes and operons 
      involved in galactose transport and metabolism have promoters containing similar 
      regulatory sequences. These sequences are recognized by at least three 
      regulators, Gal repressor (GalR), Gal isorepressor (GalS) and cAMP receptor 
      protein (CRP), which modulate transcription from these promoters. The negative 
      regulators, GalR and GalS, discriminate between utilization of the high-affinity 
      (regulated by GalS) and low-affinity (regulated by GalR) transport systems, and 
      modulate the expression of genes for galactose metabolism in an overlapping 
      fashion. GalS is itself autogenously regulated and CRP dependent, while the gene 
      for GalR is constitutive. The gal operon encoding the enzymes for galactose 
      metabolism has two promoters regulated by CRP in opposite ways; one (P1) is 
      stimulated and the other (P2) inhibited by CRP. Both promoters are strongly 
      repressed by GalR but weakly by GalS. All but one of the constituent promoters of 
      the gal regulon have two operators. The gal regulon has the potential to 
      coordinate galactose metabolism and transport in a highly efficient manner, under 
      a wide variety of conditions of galactose availability.

TI  - Characterization of promoter recognition complexes formed by CRP and CytR for 
      repression and by CRP and RNA polymerase for activation of transcription on the 
      Escherichia coli deoP2 promoter.
PG  - 17471-7
AB  - The structure of the cAMP-CRP-CytR repression complex and the cAMP CRP-RNA 
      polymerase initiation complex at the deoP2 promoter of E. coli have been probed 
      by DNase I and uranyl footprinting. In the CRP2-CytR complex all protein 
      DNA-phosphate contacts at CRP-1 and CRP-2 are retained, and in addition two new 
      minor groove contacts, ascribed to phosphate-CytR interactions, are observed at 
      -60 between the CRP sites. The contacts are compatible with a model in which the 
      promoter DNA is wrapped around a complex of two CRPs and one CytR. In the RNA 
      polymerase-CRP complex, the CRP-1 phosphate contacts are almost identical to 
      those seen in the repression complex and strong RNA polymerase contacts are seen 
      in the -10 and in the +10 regions. Most noteworthy are minor groove contacts in 
      the -60 region ascribed to RNA polymerase contacts upstream from the CRP. 
      Furthermore, binding of CRP to the CRP-2 target does not seem to interfere with 
      RNA polymerase binding. Thus, a model is suggested in which the DNA is wrapped 
      around a complex of RNA polymerase and one CRP. Finally, the results show that 
      CytR and RNA polymerase are rivals that compete for binding with CRP at deoP2 and 
      that CytR functions as an antiactivator.

TI  - Co-dependent positive regulation of the ansB promoter of Escherichia coli by CRP 
      and the FNR protein: a molecular analysis.
PG  - 155-64
AB  - Transcription of the ansB gene, encoding L-asparaginase II, is positively 
      regulated by cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and by the product of the fnr gene, the 
      FNR protein. These global regulatory proteins mediate the expression of ansB in 
      Escherichia coli in response to carbon source and to anaerobiosis, respectively, 
      and are required concurrently for optimal ansB expression. The mechanism whereby 
      CRP and FNR interact co-operatively with the ansB promoter to achieve 
      transcription has not previously been established. We have utilized an 
      ansB'-'lacZ fusion, in conjunction with deletion analysis and site-directed 
      mutagenesis, to identify two sites which interact with these regulatory proteins 
      in the ansB promoter. The first is an FNR site, centred 41.5 bp upstream of the 
      major transcriptional start site. The second site, located 28 bp upstream of the 
      FNR site, is the site of CRP regulation. This site is homologous to both the CRP 
      and FNR binding-site consensus sequences and may respond to both CRP and FNR. The 
      concurrent requirement for CRP and FNR for optimal expression of ansB may be 
      explained if, first, essentially no transcription occurs unless the FNR is bound 
      at the downstream site, and, second, the level of transcription when FNR alone is 
      present is enhanced when CRP binds at the upstream site.

TI  - Identification of the activating region of catabolite gene activator protein 
      (CAP): isolation and characterization of mutants of CAP specifically defective in 
      transcription activation.
PG  - 6081-5
AB  - We have isolated 21 mutants of catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) defective 
      in transcription activation at the lac promoter but not defective in DNA binding. 
      The amino acid substitutions in the mutants map to a single region of CAP: amino 
      acids 156-162. As assessed in vitro, the substituted CAP variants are nearly 
      completely unable to activate transcription at the lac promoter but bind to DNA 
      with the same affinity and bend DNA to the same extent as wild-type CAP. Our 
      results establish that amino acids 156-162 are critical for transcription 
      activation at the lac promoter but not for DNA binding and DNA bending. In the 
      structure of CAP, amino acids 156-162 are part of a surface loop. We propose that 
      this surface loop makes a direct protein-protein contact with RNA polymerase at 
      the lac promoter.

TI  - Transcription activation at Class I CAP-dependent promoters.
PG  - 797-802
AB  - Catabolite gene activator protein (CAP)-dependent promoters can be grouped into 
      three classes, based on the requirement for transcription activation and the 
      position of the DNA site for CAP. Class I CAP-dependent promoters require only 
      CAP for transcription activation and have the DNA site for CAP located upstream 
      of the DNA site for RNA polymerase. Amino acids 156 to 162 of the 
      promoter-proximal subunit of CAP are essential for transcription activation at 
      Class I CAP-dependent promoters, but are not essential for DNA binding, and are 
      not essential for DNA bending. In the structure of the CAP-DNA complex, these 
      amino acids are located in a surface loop and form a cluster on the surface of 
      the CAP-DNA complex. Amino acids 261, 265, and 270 of the alpha subunit of RNA 
      polymerase are essential for response to transcription activation by CAP at Class 
      I CAP-dependent promoters. Several lines of evidence indicate that transcription 
      activation at Class I CAP-dependent promoters requires a direct protein-protein 
      contact between amino acids 156 to 162 of the promoter-proximal subunit of CAP 
      and a molecule of RNA polymerase bound adjacent to CAP on the same face of the 
      DNA helix. It is a strong possibility that this direct protein-protein contact 
      involves amino acids 261 and 265 of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase.

TI  - The putative sigma factor KatF is regulated posttranscriptionally during carbon 
      starvation.
PG  - 2143-9
AB  - Transcriptional and translational 'lacZ reporter fusions were constructed to the 
      katF gene, which encodes a putative sigma factor centrally involved in 
      starvation-mediated general resistance in Escherichia coli. Transcription of katF 
      was found to increase ca. twofold after carbon starvation in minimal medium. The 
      protein fusion containing the longest fragment of katF induced ca. eightfold 
      under the same conditions, whereas fusions to shorter segments showed only a 
      twofold increase in expression. The protein fusion was expressed at higher levels 
      in a strain containing a katF::Tn10 mutation, indicating katF autoregulation. The 
      posttranscriptional regulation of katF by starvation did not require a component 
      of the spent minimal medium. katF was also posttranscriptionally regulated during 
      entry into late log phase in complex medium. This induction was coincident with 
      an increase in katE transcription, suggesting that the cellular concentration of 
      KatF directly followed the induction of the katF protein fusion.

TI  - Control of transcription of gal repressor and isorepressor genes in Escherichia 
      coli.
PG  - 251-8
AB  - Two regulatory proteins, Gal repressor and isorepressor, control the expression 
      of the gal and mgl operons in Escherichia coli. The transcription start sites for 
      galR and galS, the genes for the repressor and isorepressor, were determined by 
      primer extension of in vivo transcripts. Study of the promoter-lacZ gene fusions 
      introduced into the chromosome indicated that galS expression was elevated in 
      cells in which the normal galS gene was interrupted, but not in cells in which 
      the galR gene was deleted. When both genes were disrupted, galS expression was 
      further elevated. Expression from the galS promoter was stimulated by the 
      addition of D-fucose, repressed by glucose, and dependent on cyclic AMP receptor 
      protein (CRP). Expression of a similar gene fusion of the galR promoter to lacZ 
      was unregulated. Both galR and galS genes contain two potential operator sites 
      (OE and OI) and a CRP-binding site. The arrangement of OE, OI, and the 
      CRP-binding site in the galS gene is analogous to the arrangement in the gal and 
      mgl promoters, but the arrangement in galR is atypical. The increased 
      concentration of the isorepressor when inducer is present may facilitate early 
      shutoff of the isorepressor-regulated genes of the gal regulon when inducer 
      (substrate) concentration falls.

TI  - Sequence elements in the Escherichia coli araFGH promoter.
PG  - 6862-71
AB  - The Escherichia coli araFGH operon codes for proteins involved in the L-arabinose 
      high-affinity transport system. Transcriptional regulation of the operon was 
      studied by creating point mutations and deletions in the control region cloned 
      into a GalK expression vector. The transcription start site was confirmed by RNA 
      sequencing of transcripts. The sequences essential for polymerase function were 
      localized by deletions and point mutations. Surprisingly, only a weak -10 
      consensus sequence, and no -35 sequence is required. Mutation of a guanosine at 
      position -12 greatly reduced promoter activity, which suggests important 
      polymerase interactions with DNA between the usual -10 and -35 positions. A 
      double mutation toward the consensus in the -10 region was required to create a 
      promoter capable of significant AraC-independent transcription. These results 
      show that the araFGH promoter structure is similar to that of the galP1 promoter 
      and is substantially different from that of the araBAD promoter. The effects of 
      11 mutations within the DNA region thought to bind the cyclic AMP receptor 
      protein correlate well with the CRP consensus binding sequence and confirm that 
      this region is responsible for cyclic AMP regulation. Deletion of the AraC 
      binding site nearest the promoter, araFG1, eliminates arabinose regulation, 
      whereas deletion of the upstream AraC binding site, araFG2, has only a slight 
      effect on promoter activity.

TI  - Catabolite gene activator protein and integration host factor act in concert to 
      regulate tdc operon expression in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 6918-27
AB  - Anaerobic expression of the tdcABC operon of Escherichia coli requires cyclic AMP 
      and the catabolite gene activator protein (CAP). Purified CAP binds to a 30-bp 
      sequence in the tdc promoter between positions -55 and -26, and a mutant CAP site 
      with base substitutions at positions -48, -47, and -45 failed to bind CAP and 
      also drastically reduced the beta-galactosidase expression from a tdcB'-'lacZ 
      fusion plasmid. Recently, we showed that efficient expression of the tdc operon 
      also requires a functional integration host factor (IHF) and an IHF-binding site 
      in the tdc promoter between positions -118 and -88. The levels of 
      beta-galactosidase activity from the tdcB'-'lacZ fusion plasmids were also 
      reduced in an IHF-deficient strain with the wild-type or mutant plasmid CAP 
      sequence. In vitro footprinting experiments revealed that CAP and IHF occupy 
      their specific binding sites on tdc DNA when they are present separately or 
      together. These regulatory proteins also induced significant bending of the tdc 
      promoter DNA. Our results suggest that CAP and IHF act in concert as positive 
      transcription factors for tdc operon expression in vivo.

TI  - The cAMP-CRP/CytR nucleoprotein complex in Escherichia coli: two pairs of closely 
      linked binding sites for the cAMP-CRP activator complex are involved in 
      combinatorial regulation of the cdd promoter.
PG  - 3635-43
AB  - Transcription initiation at CytR regulated promoters in Escherichia coli is 
      controlled by a combinatorial regulatory system in which the cAMP receptor 
      protein (CRP) functions as both an activator and a co-repressor. By combining 
      genetic studies and footprinting analyses, we demonstrate that regulated 
      expression of the CytR controlled cdd promoter requires three CRP-binding sites: 
      a high affinity site (CRP-1) and two overlapping low affinity sites (CRP-2 and 
      CRP-3) centred at positions -41, -91 and -93, respectively. In the absence of 
      CytR, cAMP-CRP interacts at one set of sites (CRP-1 and CRP-2) and both of these 
      binding sites are required for full promoter activation. In the presence of CytR, 
      however, the two regulators bind cooperatively to cddP forming a nucleoprotein 
      complex in which cAMP-CRP binds to CRP-1 and CRP-3 and CytR occupies the sequence 
      between these sites. Thus, association of the two regulators involves a 
      repositioning of the cAMP-CRP complex. Moreover, mutant cdd promoters in which 
      CRP-2 and CRP-3 have been deleted are partially regulated by CytR, and cAMP-CRP 
      and CytR still bind cooperatively to these promoters. These findings provide 
      clues to an understanding of how cAMP-CRP and CytR interact at a structurally 
      diverse set of promoters.

TI  - cAMP-CRP activator complex and the CytR repressor protein bind co-operatively to 
      the cytRP promoter in Escherichia coli and CytR antagonizes the cAMP-CRP-induced 
      DNA bend.
PG  - 396-406
AB  - Initiation of transcription from the cytRP promoter in Escherichia coli is 
      activated by the cAMP-CRP complex and negatively regulated by the CytR repressor 
      protein. By combining gel retardation and footprinting assays, we show that 
      cAMP-CRP binds to a single site centered at position -64 and induces a 
      considerable bend in the DNA. CytR binds to a region immediately downstream from, 
      and partially overlapping, the CRP site, and induces a modest bend into the DNA. 
      In combination, cAMP-CRP and CytR bind co-operatively to cytRP forming a 
      nucleoprotein complex in which the proteins directly interact with each other and 
      bind to the same face of the DNA helix. CytR binding concomitantly antagonizes 
      the cAMP-CRP-induced bend. This study indicates that the minimal DNA region 
      required to obtain CytR regulation consists of a single binding site for each of 
      cAMP-CRP and CytR. The case described here, in which a protein-induced DNA bend 
      is modulated by a second protein, may illustrate a mechanism that applies to 
      other regulatory systems.

TI  - A new aspect of transcriptional control of the Escherichia coli crp gene: 
      positive autoregulation.
PG  - 2489-97
AB  - Transcription of the Escherichia coli crp gene is negatively regulated by 
      CRP-cAMP that binds to a specific site located downstream of the crp promoter. A 
      second binding site for CRP-cAMP (CRP site II) exists upstream of the crp 
      promoter. Using an in vitro transcription assay, we have demonstrated that 
      CRP-cAMP activates transcription of crp in certain conditions. A promoter which 
      carries an altered CRP-binding site II is no longer activated by CRP-cAMP, 
      indicating that CRP site II mediates the activation of crp transcription. The 
      concentrations of cAMP that are required for positive autoregulation are higher 
      than those for negative autoregulation. Evidence for positive and negative 
      autoregulation in vivo is presented by a quantitative S1 nuclease analysis.

TI  - Identification and molecular analysis of glgS, a novel growth-phase-regulated and 
      rpoS-dependent gene involved in glycogen synthesis in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1877-86
AB  - The putative stationary-phase sigma factor (sigma S) encoded by rpoS is essential 
      for glycogen synthesis, but is not required for the transcription of glgC and 
      glgA, which encode ADP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase and glycogen synthase, 
      respectively. Using a mini-Mu random chromosomal library and a screen for 
      glycogen overproduction, we identified a novel gene (glgS) involved in glycogen 
      synthesis. glgS maps at 66.6 min (3247 kb) on the chromosome and constitutes a 
      monocistronic operon. It encodes a hydrophilic and highly charged small protein, 
      with a molecular weight of 7886, which is strongly expressed in minicells. 
      Experiments with single-copy chromosomal glgS::lacZ gene fusions indicated that 
      glgS expression is controlled by sigma S as well as by cAMP. Two transcriptional 
      start sites were mapped in the upstream regulatory region of glgS. The glgSp1 
      transcript was absent in a cya mutant, whereas an rpoS mutant did not synthesize 
      the glgSp2 transcript. Although glycogen synthesis is strongly stimulated by 
      overproduction of GlgS and is inhibited by a glgS null mutation, glgS does not 
      affect the expression of the glgCAP operon. Its potential role in the metabolic 
      control of glycogen synthesis is discussed. Also, evidence is presented to show 
      that the amount of glycogen accumulated in vivo in early stationary-phase cells 
      is mainly determined by sigma S-controlled gene expression and allosteric 
      activation of GlgC, whereas the absolute levels of expression of glgCAP as well 
      as the intracellular concentration of cAMP are of minor importance.

TI  - Promoter elements required for positive control of transcription of the 
      Escherichia coli uhpT gene.
PG  - 2763-70
AB  - The uhpABCT locus of Escherichia coli encodes the transport system which allows 
      the cell to accumulate a variety of sugar phosphates in unaltered form. The 
      expression of uhpT, the gene encoding the transport protein, is regulated by the 
      uhpABC gene products. The UhpA protein is required for expression; its deduced 
      amino acid sequence shows that it belongs to a subfamily of bacterial 
      transcription regulators including NarL, DegU, and FixJ. Members of this 
      subfamily have an amino-terminal phosphorylation domain characteristic of 
      so-called two-component regulators, such as OmpR, CheY, PhoB, and NtrC, and a 
      carboxyl-terminal domain conserved among many transcriptional activators, 
      including LuxR and MalT. The major sequence elements in the uhpT promoter that 
      are needed for uhpT expression were investigated. Northern (RNA) hybridization 
      analysis showed that the uhpT transcript was only present in cells induced for 
      UhpT transport activity. The start site of transcription was identified by primer 
      extension. Comparison of the regions upstream of the uhpT transcription start 
      site in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium suggested the presence of four 
      sequence elements that might be involved in promoter function: a typical -10 
      region, a short inverted repeat centered at -32, a long inverted repeat centered 
      at -64, and a cyclic AMP receptor protein-binding sequence centered at -103. 
      Deletion and linker substitution mutations in the promoter demonstrated that the 
      presence of the cyclic AMP receptor protein-binding site resulted in about an 
      eightfold increase in promoter activity and that the -64, -32, and -10 elements 
      were essential for promoter function. In vivo titration of transcriptional 
      activator UhpA by the intact or mutant promoters on multicopy plasmids identified 
      the -64 element as the UhpA-binding site. The two halves of the -64 inverted 
      repeat did not contribute equally to promoter function and did not have to be 
      intact for UhpA titration. The sequence recognized by UhpA is predicted to be 5' 
      -GGCAAAACNNNGAAA.

TI  - Interaction at a distance between multiple operators controls the adjacent, 
      divergently transcribed glpTQ-glpACB operons of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 6114-21
AB  - The glp regulon of Escherichia coli encodes the proteins required for utilization 
      of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and its precursors. Transcription of the divergently 
      transcribed glpTQ and glpACB operons is initiated at sites separated by 132 base 
      pairs (bp) of DNA. These operons are controlled negatively by glp repressor and 
      positively by the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex. The locations of the 
      binding sites for the glp repressor and for cAMP.CRP in the control regions of 
      these operons were determined by DNase I footprinting. Binding of the glp 
      repressor protected the region -32 to -51 (OT) in the glpTQ promoter, which was 
      also the binding site for cAMP.CRP. Four repressor binding sites (-41 to -60 
      (OA1), -9 to -28 (OA2), +12 to -8 (OA3), and +52 to +33 (OA4)) and two cAMP.CRP 
      binding sites (+11 to -11 and -30 to -51) were found in the glpACB promoter 
      region. Comparison of the sequences of the repressor binding sites found in the 
      glpTQ-glpACB control region with those operators previously described in the glpD 
      operon allowed formulation of a consensus operator sequence which was the 
      palindrome 5'-WATGTTCGWTAWC-GAACATW-3' (W is A or T). The role of each operator 
      was assessed by measuring repression in constructs where individual operators 
      were altered by site-directed mutagenesis. Alteration of OT did not significantly 
      decrease repression of either operon. Each of the glpACB operators contributed to 
      repression of both operons. These results suggest involvement of glpACB 
      operator(s) in control of glpTQ expression perhaps via formation of a repression 
      loop. Evidence supporting this hypothesis was obtained by measuring the degree of 
      repression of the glpTQ promoter in constructs containing 6- or 10-bp insertions 
      between the glpTQ and glpACB operators. A 6-bp insertion located within OA2 or 
      between OT and OA1 eliminated repression of the glpTQ promoter, whereas 
      significant repression was maintained in the case of a 10-bp insertion within 
      OA2.

TI  - Structure and regulation of the glpFK operon encoding glycerol diffusion 
      facilitator and glycerol kinase of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 6122-31
AB  - The glpFK operon maps near minute 88 on the linkage map of Escherichia coli K-12 
      with glpF promoter proximal. The glpF gene encodes a cytoplasmic membrane protein 
      which facilitates the diffusion of glycerol into the cell. The glpK gene encodes 
      glycerol kinase. In the present work, the nucleotide sequence of the 5'-end of 
      the operon, including the control region, the glpF gene, and part of the glpK 
      gene, was determined. The facilitator was predicted to contain 281 amino acids 
      with a calculated molecular weight of 29,780. It is a highly hydrophobic protein 
      with a minimum of six potential transmembrane alpha helices. The transcription 
      start site for the glpFK operon was located 71 base pairs upstream from the 
      proposed translation start codon for glpF. Preceding the transcription start site 
      were sequences similar to the -10 and -35 consensus sequences for bacterial 
      promoters. Binding sites for the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex and the 
      glp repressor were identified by DNase I footprinting. The region protected by 
      the cAMP.CRP complex contained tandem sequences resembling the consensus sequence 
      for CRP binding. The CRP sites were centered at 37.5 and 60.5 base pairs upstream 
      of the start of transcription. The glp repressor protected an extensive area (-89 
      to -7 relative to the start point of transcription), sufficient for the binding 
      of four repressor tetramers. Two additional binding sites for the repressor were 
      identified within the glpK coding region. The DNA containing these two operators 
      synergistically increased the apparent affinity of glp repressor for DNA 
      fragments containing the four operators in the promoter region of the glpFK 
      operon. With this study, a total of 13 operators for the glp regulon have been 
      characterized. Comparison of these operators revealed the consensus 
      5'-WATGTTCGWT-3' for the operator half-site (W = A or T). The relative affinity 
      of the glp repressor for the various glp operators was assessed in vivo using a 
      promoter-probe vector. The relative apparent affinity of the control regions for 
      glp repressor was glpFK greater than glpD greater than glpACB greater than glpTQ. 
      The degree of catabolite repression for each of the operons was assessed using a 
      similar system. In this case, the relative sensitivity of the glp operons to 
      catabolite repression was glpTQ greater than glpFK greater than glpACB greater 
      than glpD.

TI  - Molecular characterization of the MalT-dependent periplasmic alpha-amylase of 
      Escherichia coli encoded by malS.
PG  - 5148-54
AB  - malS, the gene encoding the periplasmic alpha-amylase, is under the regulatory 
      control of the MalT protein, the gene activator of the Escherichia coli maltose 
      system. We sequenced the DNA region encoding malS and its control elements. malS 
      consists of an open reading frame of 2,028 base pairs encoding a protein of 676 
      amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 75,664 including a typical 
      amino-terminal signal sequence of 17 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence 
      of malS was compared with that of other proteins. We found homologies to 
      alpha-amylases and a cyclodextrin glucanotransferase but not to beta-amylases. In 
      addition, MalS showed significant homology to another maltodextrin-utilizing and 
      MalT-dependent enzyme of E. coli, maltodextrin glucosidase (MalZ) but not to 
      amylomaltase (MalQ), the major maltodextrin-degrading enzyme. Conserved regions 
      that have been proposed to constitute enzymatically active sites in 
      alpha-amylases are present in MalS. Two of these sequences can also be found in 
      the amino terminus of the lambda-receptor, a maltodextrin-specific channel in the 
      outer membrane. The nucleotide sequence of the control region of malS revealed 
      MalT binding sites correctly spaced for the start of the malS transcript. At the 
      position 219 base pairs upstream of malS, we found a divergently transcribed 
      gene, bax, which has been recognized previously. Downstream of malS, after a 
      513-base pair intergenic region, lies the convergently transcribed gene avtA, 
      which codes for the alanine/valine transaminase.

TI  - Positive and negative control of ompB transcription in Escherichia coli by cyclic 
      AMP and the cyclic AMP receptor protein.
PG  - 664-70
AB  - The ompB operon encodes OmpR and EnvZ, two proteins that are necessary for the 
      expression and osmoregulation of the OmpF and OmpC porins in Escherichia coli. We 
      have used in vitro and in vivo experiments to show that cyclic AMP and the cyclic 
      AMP receptor protein (CRP) directly regulate ompB. ompB expression in an 
      ompB-lacZ chromosomal fusion strain was increased two- to fivefold when cells 
      were grown in medium containing poor carbon sources or with added cyclic AMP. In 
      vivo primer extension analysis indicated that this control is complex and 
      involves both positive and negative effects by cyclic AMP-CRP on multiple ompB 
      promoters. In vitro footprinting showed that cyclic AMP-CRP binds to a 34-bp site 
      centered at -53 and at -75 in relation to the start sites of the major 
      transcripts that are inhibited and activated, respectively, by this complex. 
      Site-directed mutagenesis of the crp binding site provided evidence that this 
      site is necessary for the in vivo regulation of ompB expression by cyclic AMP. 
      Control of the ompB operon by cyclic AMP-CRP may account for the observed 
      regulation of the formation of OmpF and OmpC by this complex (N. W. Scott and C. 
      R. Harwood, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 9:95-98, 1980).

      Escherichia coli arabinose regulon.
PG  - 7765-71
AB  - We report the mapping, sequencing, and study of the physiological role of the 
      fourth arabinose-inducible operon from Escherichia coli, araJ. It is located at 9 
      min on the chromosome and codes for a single 42-kDa protein that shows no 
      significant homology to other known proteins. Destruction of the chromosomal araJ 
      gene does not detectably affect either of the two arabinose transport systems, 
      the ability of cells to grow on arabinose, or the induction kinetics of the 
      araBAD operon, and thus the physiological role of AraJ, if any, remains unknown. 
      We have also found a long open reading frame upstream of araJ. The sequence of 
      this upstream open reading frame was found to be identical to the previously 
      reported sequence of the sbcC gene (I. S. Naom, S. J. Morton, D. R. F. Leach, and 
      R. G. Lloyd, Nucleic Acids Res. 17:8033-8044, 1989). The carboxyl region of SbcC 
      has an amino acid sequence consistent with this region of SbcC forming an 
      extended alpha-helical coiled-coil.

TI  - Restored DNA-binding of the cAMP-CRP activator complex reestablishes negative 
      regulation by the CytR repressor in the deoP2 promoter in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 76-80
AB  - We have investigated in vivo the coupling between CytR regulation of the deoP2 
      promoter in Escherichia coli and the DNA-binding specificity of the cAMP-CRP 
      (cAMP receptor protein) complex in order to obtain a more detailed picture of the 
      role played by cAMP-CRP in CytR regulation. By introducing CRP proteins that 
      exhibit an altered DNA binding specificity into a strain containing a mutant 
      deoP2 promoter in which cAMP-CRP activation was decreased and CytR regulation 
      completely abolished, we show that CytR regulation of this promoter can be 
      reestablished by restored the DNA binding of the cAMP-CRP complex. Hence, CytR 
      regulation of deoP2 can be modulated by simply varying DNA binding of cAMP-CRP. 
      These data confirm the crucial role played by the cAMP-CRP activator complex in 
      CytR regulation of the deoP2 promoter.

TI  - Heterologous cooperativity in Escherichia coli. The CytR repressor both contacts 
      DNA and the cAMP receptor protein when binding to the deoP2 promoter.
PG  - 17804-8
AB  - Promoters in Escherichia coli that are negatively regulated by the CytR repressor 
      are also activated by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complexed to cAMP; as a 
      characteristic, these promoters encode two binding sites for the cAMP.CRP 
      complex. Biochemical and genetic studies have shown that CytR relies on 
      interactions with the cAMP.CRP complex in order to bind promoter DNA and repress 
      transcription. Here we have purified CytR to near homogeneity and addressed the 
      question of how it interacts with the deoP2 promoter. Gel retardation and DNase I 
      footprinting analyses show that CytR is a true sequence-specific DNA-binding 
      protein that binds to the sequence between the two CRP sites in deoP2 with a 
      relatively low affinity. In the presence of the cAMP.CRP complex the two protein 
      species bind cooperatively to deoP2, forming a complex in which CytR occupies the 
      sequence between the two DNA bound cAMP.CRP complexes. Furthermore, the inducer 
      (cytidine) does not affect independent DNA binding of CytR, rather the 
      CytR/cAMP.CRP cooperativity is perturbed. These results indicate that CytR 
      binding to deoP2 relies on both repressor-DNA interactions and protein-protein 
      interactions to cAMP.CRP. This combinatorial repression mechanism, in which an 
      activator functions as an adaptor for a repressor that is not capable of blocking 
      transcription on its own, is unprecedented in prokaryotes; it is, however, 
      reminiscent of repression mechanisms found in eukaryotes.

TI  - The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein complex functions both as an 
      activator and as a corepressor at the tsx-p2 promoter of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 5419-30
AB  - The tsx-p2 promoter is one of at least seven Escherichia coli promoters that are 
      activated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex and 
      negatively regulated by the CytR repressor. DNase I footprinting assays were used 
      to study the interactions of these regulatory proteins with the tsx-p2 promoter 
      region and to characterize tsx-p2 regulatory mutants exhibiting an altered 
      response to CytR. We show that the cAMP-CRP activator complex recognizes two 
      sites in tsx-p2 that are separated by 33 bp: a high-affinity site (CRP-1) 
      overlaps the -35 region, and a low-affinity site (CRP-2) is centered around 
      position -74 bp. The CytR repressor protects a DNA segment that is located 
      between the two CRP sites and partially overlaps the CRP-1 target. In 
      combination, the cAMP-CRP and CytR proteins bind cooperatively to tsx-p2, and the 
      nucleoprotein complex formed covers a region of 78 bp extending from the CRP-2 
      site close to the -10 region. The inducer for the CytR repressor, cytidine, does 
      not prevent in vitro DNA binding of CytR, but releases the repressor from the 
      nucleoprotein complex and leaves the cAMP-CRP activator bound to its two DNA 
      targets. Thus, cytidine interferes with the cooperative DNA binding of cAMP-CRP 
      and CytR to tsx-p2. We characterized four tsx-p2 mutants exhibiting a reduced 
      response to CytR; three carried mutations in the CRP-2 site, and one carried a 
      mutation in the region between CRP-1 and the -10 sequence. Formation of the 
      cAMP-CRP-CytR DNA nucleoprotein complex in vitro was perturbed in each mutant. 
      These data indicate that the CytR repressor relies on the presence of the 
      cAMP-CRP activator complex to regulate tsx-p2 promoter activity and that the 
      formation of an active repression complex requires the combined interactions of 
      cAMP-CRP and CytR at tsx-p2.

TI  - Crystal structure of a CAP-DNA complex: the DNA is bent by 90 degrees.
PG  - 1001-7
AB  - The 3 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the Escherichia coli catabolite 
      gene activator protein (CAP) complexed with a 30-base pair DNA sequence shows 
      that the DNA is bent by 90 degrees. This bend results almost entirely from two 40 
      degrees kinks that occur between TG/CA base pairs at positions 5 and 6 on each 
      side of the dyad axis of the complex. DNA sequence discrimination by CAP derives 
      both from sequence-dependent distortion of the DNA helix and from direct 
      hydrogen-bonding interactions between three protein side chains and the exposed 
      edges of three base pairs in the major groove of the DNA. The structure of this 
      transcription factor--DNA complex provides insights into possible mechanisms of 
      transcription activation.

TI  - Molecular mechanism of negative autoregulation of Escherichia coli crp gene.
PG  - 4413-9
AB  - Transcription of the Escherichia coli crp gene encoding cAMP receptor protein 
      (CRP) is negatively regulated by CRP-cAMP complex that binds to a specific site 
      located downstream from the transcription start site. The binding of CRP-cAMP to 
      this site activates transcription from a second divergent overlapping promoter. 
      The mechanism of this negative autoregulation of the crp gene has been 
      investigated by in vitro transcription, gel shift, DNase I footprinting, and 
      exonuclease III protection assays. We demonstrated that the crp and divergent 
      promoters are reciprocally and coordinately regulated by CRP-cAMP. The abortive 
      initiation assay revealed that the divergent RNA itself is not required for the 
      inhibition of crp transcription. Detailed binding studies revealed that CRP-cAMP 
      stimulates the binding of RNA polymerase to the divergent promoter and thus 
      blocks the occupation of the crp promoter by RNA polymerase.

TI  - The malX malY operon of Escherichia coli encodes a novel enzyme II of the 
      phosphotransferase system recognizing glucose and maltose and an enzyme 
      abolishing the endogenous induction of the maltose system.
PG  - 4862-76
AB  - Mutants lacking MalK, a subunit of the binding protein-dependent 
      maltose-maltodextrin transport system, constitutively express the maltose genes. 
      A second site mutation in malI abolishes the constitutive expression. The malI 
      gene (at 36 min on the linkage map) codes for a typical repressor protein that is 
      homologous to the Escherichia coli LacI, GalR, or CytR repressor (J. Reidl, K. 
      Römisch, M. Ehrmann, and W. Boos, J. Bacteriol. 171:4888-4899, 1989). We now 
      report that MalI regulates an adjacent and divergently oriented operon containing 
      malX and malY. MalX encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 56,654, and the 
      deduced amino acid sequence of MalX exhibits 34.9% identity to the enzyme II of 
      the phosphototransferase system for glucose (ptsG) and 32.1% identity to the 
      enzyme II for N-acetylglucosamine (nagE). When constitutively expressed, malX can 
      complement a ptsG ptsM double mutant for growth on glucose. Also, a delta malE 
      malT(Con) strain that is unable to grow on maltose due to its maltose transport 
      defect becomes Mal+ after introduction of malI::Tn10 and the plasmid carrying 
      malX. MalX-mediated transport of glucose and maltose is likely to occur by 
      facilitated diffusion. We conclude that malX encodes a phosphotransferase system 
      enzyme II that can recognize glucose and maltose as substrates even though these 
      sugars may not represent the natural substrates of the system. The second gene in 
      the operon, malY, encodes a protein of 43,500 daltons. Its deduced amino acid 
      sequence exhibits weak homology to aminotransferase sequences. The presence of 
      plasmid-encoded MalX alone was sufficient for complementing growth on glucose in 
      a ptsM ptsG glk mutant, and the plasmid-encoded MalY alone was sufficient to 
      abolish the constitutivity of the mal genes in a malK mutant. The overexpression 
      of malY in a strain that is wild type with respect to the maltose genes strongly 
      interferes with growth on maltose. This is not the case in a malT(Con) strain 
      that expresses the mal genes constitutively. We conclude that malY encodes an 
      enzyme that degrades the inducer of the maltose system or prevents its synthesis.

TI  - Downstream deletion analysis of the lac promoter.
PG  - 4570-7
AB  - We have generated a series of deletions in the downstream region of the lac 
      promoter. The promoter activities of these mutations were compared by measuring 
      the levels of beta-galactosidase gene expression in vivo. Our results show that 
      deletion of downstream lac promoter sequences changes the promoter strength only 
      two- to threefold. The effects of these deletions on transcription initiation 
      site location were studied through primer extension assay of in vivo mRNAs. We 
      found that the transcription start sites are primarily chosen as an approximate 
      distance from the -10 region of the lac promoter; however, starts are sometimes 
      manifested at a GAATT(C) sequence, which is identical to the wild-type preferred 
      start site. lac promoter P2 and a newly identified promoter, P3, are transcribed 
      in vivo at low levels. Catabolite activator protein complexed with cyclic AMP 
      represses P2 and P3 expression in vivo. The secondary catabolite activator 
      protein binding site plays at most a modest role in catabolite repression in 
      vivo.

TI  - Bipartite functional map of the E. coli RNA polymerase alpha subunit: involvement 
      of the C-terminal region in transcription activation by cAMP-CRP.
PG  - 1015-22
AB  - The alpha subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase plays a major role in the 
      subunit assembly. Carboxyterminal deletion derivatives lacking 73 or 94 amino 
      acid residues were assembled in vitro into enzyme molecules. Core enzymes 
      consisting of these C-terminal-truncated alpha subunits were as active in RNA 
      synthesis as native core enzyme. By the addition of sigma 70 subunit, these 
      mutant enzymes initiated transcription from certain promoters. The mutant RNA 
      polymerases, however, did not show cAMP-CRP activated transcription. These 
      results demonstrate that the N-terminal region of the alpha subunit is involved 
      in the formation of active enzyme molecule, while the C-terminal region plays an 
      essential role in response to transcription activation by cAMP-CRP.

TI  - Single amino acid substitutions in the cAMP receptor protein specifically abolish 
      regulation by the CytR repressor in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 4921-5
AB  - Promoters in Escherichia coli that are negatively regulated by the CytR repressor 
      are also activated by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complexed to cAMP; as a 
      characteristic, these promoters encode tandem binding sites for cAMP-CRP. In one 
      such promoter, deoP2, CytR binds to the region between the tandem CRP binding 
      sites with a relatively low affinity; in the presence of cAMP-CRP, however, the 
      repressor and activator bind cooperatively to the DNA. Here we have investigated 
      this cooperativity by isolating mutants of the CRP protein that abolish CytR 
      regulation without exhibiting a concomitant loss in their ability to activate 
      transcription. Four different, single amino acid substitutions in CRP give rise 
      to this phenotype. These amino acids lie in close proximity on the surface of the 
      CRP tertiary structure in a portion of the protein that is not in contact with 
      the DNA. In vitro analyses of one of the CRP mutants show that it interacts with 
      the DNA in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type CRP, whereas its interaction 
      with CytR is perturbed. These results strongly indicate that cooperative DNA 
      binding of CytR and cAMP-CRP is achieved through protein-protein interactions.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence and characterization of the sfs1 gene: sfs1 is involved in 
      CRP*-dependent mal gene expression in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 2644-8
AB  - We have cloned at least 12 different Escherichia coli genes which enable strain 
      MK2001 to use maltose. The genes were designated sfs1 through sfs12 (sugar 
      fermentation stimulation). Previously, one (sfs7) of them was mapped at 65 min on 
      the E. coli chromosome and identified as nlp, which has high homology to 
      repressor protein (Ner) of Mu phage, which contains a putative DNA binding region 
      (Y.-L. Choi, T. Nishida, M. Kawamukai, R. Utsumi, H. Sakai, and T. Komano, J. 
      Bacteriol. 171:5222-5225, 1989). In this study, another gene (sfs1) located at 
      3.5 min was newly found and analyzed. The nucleotide sequence of sfs1 encoded a 
      protein of 234 amino acids (molecular mass, 26,227 Da) which also has a putative 
      DNA binding domain. Overexpression of the sfs1 gene in MK2001 resulted in a 
      10-fold increase of amylomaltase, which was still dependent on MalT. These 
      results suggest that Sfs1 could be a new regulatory factor involved in maltose 
      metabolism.

TI  - A novel function of the cAMP-CRP complex in Escherichia coli: cAMP-CRP functions 
      as an adaptor for the CytR repressor in the deo operon.
PG  - 969-75
AB  - Unlike classical bacterial repressors, the CytR repressor of Escherichia coli 
      cannot independently regulate gene expression. Here we show that CytR binding to 
      the deoP2 promoter relies on interaction with the master gene regulatory protein, 
      CRP, and, furthermore, that cAMP-CRP and CytR bind co-operatively to deoP2. Using 
      mutant promoters we show that tandem, properly spaced DNA-bound cAMP-CRP 
      complexes are required for this co-operative binding. These data suggest that 
      CytR forms a bridge between tandem cAMP-CRP complexes, and that cAMP-CRP 
      functions as an adaptor for CytR. The implications of this new version of 
      negative control in E. coli on bacterial gene expression and on combinatorial 
      gene regulation in higher organisms are discussed.

TI  - AraC-DNA looping: orientation and distance-dependent loop breaking by the cyclic 
      AMP receptor protein.
PG  - 45-54
AB  - The arabinose operon promoter, pBAD, is negatively regulated in the absence of 
      arabinose by AraC protein, which forms a DNA loop by binding to two sites 
      separated by 210 base-pairs, araO2 and araI1. pBAD is also positively regulated 
      by AraC-arabinose and the cyclic AMP receptor protein, CRP. We provide evidence 
      that CRP breaks the araO2-araI1 repression loop in vitro. The ability of CRP to 
      break the loop in vitro and to activate pBAD in vivo is dependent upon the 
      orientation and distance of the CRP binding site relative to araI1. An insertion 
      of one DNA helical turn, 11 base-pairs, between CRP and araI only partially 
      inhibits CRP loop breaking and activation of pBAD, while an insertion of less 
      than one DNA helical turn, 4 base-pairs, not only abolishes CRP activation and 
      loop breaking, but actually causes CRP to stabilize the loop and increases the 
      araO2-mediated repression of pBAD. Both integral and non-integral insertions of 
      greater than one helical turn completely abolish CRP activation and loop breaking 
      in vitro.

TI  - Molecular and functional characterization of a carbon starvation gene of

PG  - 129-40
AB  - Escherichia coli induces the synthesis of at least 30 proteins at the onset of 
      carbon starvation, two-thirds of which are positively regulated by the cyclic AMP 
      (cAMP) and cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex. Two of the cAMP-CRP-dependent 
      genes mapped to 14 and 93 minutes of the chromosome and are designated cstA and 
      cstB, respectively. The cstA promoter region was cloned and localized to a 600 
      base-pair fragment downstream from the iron-regulated entCEBA-P15 operon. Carbon 
      starvation-inducible transcription initiated at three sites spaced one turn of 
      the DNA helix apart. All had--10 sequences similar to consensus E sigma 70 
      promoters and poor--35 sequences. Deletion of a putative CRP binding site 
      abolished carbon starvation-mediated induction. Sequence analysis of the cstA 
      coding region revealed the presence of three sequential open reading frames 
      potentially encoding two hydrophobic proteins of 60,223 Da and 15,201 Da and a 
      hydrophilic protein of 7467 Da. Overexpression of the cstA region produced 
      starvation-inducible proteins of the expected sizes. Suggestive evidence was 
      obtained that cstA is involved in peptide utilization.

TI  - CAP and Nag repressor binding to the regulatory regions of the nagE-B and manX 
      genes of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 661-79
AB  - The divergent nagE-BACD operons located at 15.5 min on the Escherichia coli 
      chromosome encode genes involved in the uptake and metabolism of 
      N-acetylglucosamine. The start sites of the divergent transcripts are separated 
      by 133 base-pairs (bp). A repressor protein for the regulon is encoded by the 
      gene nagC, one of the genes of the nagBACD operon. Strains overproducing the NagC 
      protein have been used to investigate the binding of repressor to the intergenic 
      nagE-B regulatory region. Two binding sites have been detected, overlapping the 
      promoters of the nagE and nagB genes. NagC binding produces a series of DNase I 
      hypersensitive sites separated by 9 to 11 bp in the region between the two NagC 
      binding sites, supporting a model where the NagC proteins bind co-operatively to 
      these two sites on the DNA and interact to form a DNA loop. A strong CAP binding 
      site exists between the two operator sites. It is located at -61.5 and -71.5 
      relative to the nagE and nagB transcription start sites. CAP and NagC can bind 
      simultaneously and produce a complex more stable than the binary NagC-DNA 
      complex. In addition NagC and CAP binding sites have been found upstream from the 
      manXYZ operon. Although the sites exhibit a similar organization there is no 
      evidence for formation of a DNA loop in this operon.

TI  - Effects of structural changes in the dsdA-dsdC intergenic region on D-serine 
      deaminase synthesis.
PG  - 1161-7
AB  - Single-base-pair changes well upstream of its transcription initiation site 
      resulted in partially to fully constitutive expression of the D-serine deaminase 
      structural gene, dsdA, independently of the cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP-binding protein 
      complex and of the specific D-serine deaminase activator protein. These promoter 
      mutations appear to define a consensus sequence that is repeated several times. 
      Basal expression of dsdA+ was also strongly enhanced by subcloning on multicopy 
      plasmids, by the DNA gyrase inhibitor novobiocin, and in dsdC(Con) mutants by 
      increasing growth temperature. These results suggest that activation of dsdA+ 
      expression by the dsdC-encoded protein involves distortion of promoter DNA. A 
      dsdA translation start at bp -731 was verified by subcloning of dsdC+. 
      Plasmid-specified activator at a high concentration interfered with chromosomal 
      dsdC(Con) expression, and the interference was enhanced by deletion of most of 
      the intergenic region from the plasmid. Even at a high concentration, however, 
      plasmid-specified activator did not activate expression of chromosomal dsdA+, and 
      in one case it was actually repressive. These results confirm the strong cis 
      tropism of plasmid-specified dsdC-encoded protein and suggest that it is mediated 
      by multiple sites in the dsdA-dsdC intergenic region.

TI  - Design of cAMP-CRP-activated promoters in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 433-7
AB  - We have studied the deoP2 promoter of Escherichia coli to define features that 
      are required for optimal activation by the complex of adenosine 3',5' 
      monophosphate (cAMP) and the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). Systematic mutagenesis 
      of deoP2 shows that the distance between the CRP site and the -10 hexamer is the 
      crucial factor in determining whether the promoter is activated by cAMP-CRP. 
      Based on these observations, we propose that cAMP-CRP-activated promoters can be 
      created by correctly aligning a CRP target and a -10 hexamer. This idea has been 
      successfully tested by converting both a CRP-independent promoter and a sequence 
      resembling the consensus -10 hexamer to strongly cAMP-CRP-activated promoters.

TI  - Dual regulation of the ugp operon by phosphate and carbon starvation at two 
      interspaced promoters.
PG  - 549-58
AB  - The ugp operon of Escherichia coli includes genes involved in the uptake of 
      sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and glycerophosphoryl diesters and belongs to the pho 
      regulon which is induced by phosphate limitation. This operon has two 
      transcriptional initiation sites, as determined by S1 nuclease mapping of the in 
      vivo transcripts. The downstream promoter has multiple copies of the pho box, the 
      consensus sequence shared by the pho promoters; the upstream promoter has a 
      consensus sequence for the promoters regulated by cyclic AMP and its receptor 
      protein, CRP. PhoB protein, which is the transcriptional activator for the pho 
      regulon, protected the regulatory region with the pho boxes in DNase I 
      footprinting experiments and activated transcription from the downstream promoter 
      in vitro. Studies with transcriptional fusions between ugp and a promoterless 
      gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase show that the upstream promoter is 
      induced by carbon starvation in a manner that required the cya and crp genes. 
      PhoB protein may act as a repressor for this upstream promoter, which also 
      overlaps the upstream third pho box. The downstream promoter was induced by 
      phosphate starvation and requires the PhoB protein for its activation as do the 
      other pho regulon promoters. These results suggest that the two promoters 
      function alternately in responding to phosphate or carbon starvation, thus 
      providing the cell with a means to adapt to these physiological stresses.

TI  - The binding of cyclic AMP receptor protein to two lactose promoter sites is not 
      cooperative in vitro.
PG  - 59-66
AB  - The lactose promoter-operator region of Escherichia coli contains two binding 
      sites for cyclic AMP receptor protein (CAP), two for the lactose repressor, and 
      two for RNA polymerase. The high density of binding sites makes cooperative 
      interactions between these proteins likely. In this study, we used the gel 
      electrophoresis mobility shift assay and binding partition analysis techniques to 
      determine whether the secondary CAP site influences the binding of CAP to the 
      principal CAP site in the lactose promoter when both are present on a linear DNA 
      molecule. Such an effect could occur through the formation of a bridged 
      DNA-CAP-DNA structure, through the interaction of CAP molecules bound to each of 
      the sites, or through allosteric effects caused by CAP-mediated DNA bending. We 
      found, however, that the interaction of CAP with these sites was not cooperative, 
      indicating that CAP sites 1 and 2 bind CAP in an independent manner.

TI  - Identification of a central regulator of stationary-phase gene expression in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 49-59
AB  - During carbon-starvation-induced entry into stationary phase, Escherichia coli 
      cells exhibit a variety of physiological and morphological changes that ensure 
      survival during periods of prolonged starvation. Induction of 30-50 proteins of 
      mostly unknown function has been shown under these conditions. In an attempt to 
      identify C-starvation-regulated genes we isolated and characterized chromosomal 
      C-starvation-induced csi::lacZ fusions using the lambda placMu system. One operon 
      fusion (csi2::lacZ) has been studied in detail. csi2::lacZ was induced during 
      transition from exponential to stationary phase and was negatively regulated by 
      cAMP. It was mapped at 59 min on the E. coli chromosome and conferred a 
      pleiotropic phenotype. As demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, 
      cells carrying csi2::lacZ did not synthesize at least 16 proteins present in an 
      isogenic csi2+ strain. Cells containing csi2::lacZ or csi2::Tn10 did not produce 
      glycogen, did not develop thermotolerance and H2O2 resistance, and did not induce 
      a stationary-phase-specific acidic phosphatase (AppA) as well as another csi 
      fusion (csi5::lacZ). Moreover, they died off much more rapidly than wild-type 
      cells during prolonged starvation. We conclude that csi2::lacZ defines a 
      regulatory gene of central importanc e for stationary phase E. coli cells. These 
      results and the cloning of the wild-type gene corresponding to csi2 demonstrated 
      that the csi2 locus is allelic with the previously identified regulatory genes 
      katF and appR. The katF sequence indicated that its gene product is a novel sigma 
      factor supposed to regulate expression of catalase HPII and exonuclease III 
      (Mulvey and Loewen, 1989). We suggest that this novel sigma subunit of RNA 
      polymerase defined by csi2/katF/appR is a central early regulator of a large 
      starvation/stationary phase regulon in E. coli and propose 'rpoS' ('sigma S') as 
      appropriate designations.

TI  - Three adjacent binding sites for cAMP receptor protein are involved in the 
      activation of the divergent malEp-malKp promoters.
PG  - 229-33
AB  - The divergent malEFG and malK-lamB-malM operons in Escherichia coli are 
      controlled by partially overlapping promoters, whose activity depends on the 
      presence of two transcriptional activators, MalT and the cAMP receptor protein 
      (CRP). The 271-base-pair region separating the transcription start points of the 
      promoters malEp and malKp comprises a compact array of binding sites for MalT and 
      CRP. We report the characterization of the in vitro interactions of CRP with its 
      four adjacent binding sites and the analysis of their function in vivo. By using 
      the DNase I footprinting technique, we showed that CRP binds with high affinity 
      to the three malEp-proximal sites and with a low affinity to the fourth site. CRP 
      binding to these sites is not cooperative, even though they are adjacent and 
      located on the same face of the DNA double helix. Each of these sites was 
      destroyed by localized mutagenesis and the residual activity of the promoters was 
      measured in vivo. Mutations in any of the three high-affinity binding sites 
      reduced both malEp and malKp activity. The participation of several adjacent 
      bound CRP molecules in the activation of a promoter is an unprecedented 
      observation and might involve molecular mechanisms quite different from those 
      used in the other CRP-controlled promoters.

TI  - Analysis of the tsx gene, which encodes a nucleoside-specific channel-forming 
      protein (Tsx) in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 59-65
AB  - The tsx gene of Escherichia coli encodes an outer membrane protein, Tsx, which 
      constitutes the receptor for colicin K and bacteriophage T6, and functions as a 
      substrate-specific channel for nucleosides and deoxynucleosides. The mini-Mu 
      element pEG5005 was used to prepare a gene bank in vivo, and this bank was used 
      to identify T6-sensitive strains carrying the cloned tsx gene. Subcloning of the 
      tsx gene into the multicopy plasmid, pBR322, resulted in a strong overproduction 
      of Tsx. The sequence of a 1477-bp DNA segment containing tsx and its flanking 
      regions was determined. An open reading frame (ORF) was found which was followed 
      by a pair of repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences. This ORF translated 
      into a protein of 294 amino acids (aa), the first 22 aa of which showed the 
      characteristic features of a bacterial signal sequence peptide. The putative 
      mature form of Tsx is composed of 272 aa with a calculated Mr of 31418. The aa 
      sequence of Tsx shows an even distribution of charged residues (52 aa) and lacks 
      extensive hydrophobic stretches. No significant homologies of Tsx to the 
      channel-forming proteins OmpC, OmpF, PhoE and LamB from the E. coli outer 
      membrane were detected. Using nuclease S1, we identified two transcription start 
      points for the tsx mRNA which were separated by approx. 150 bp. Genetic data 
      suggest that the synthesis of the larger mRNA species is directed by a weak 
      promoter (P1) that is controlled by the DeoR repressor, whereas the smaller mRNA 
      species is directed by the main promoter P2, which is negatively controlled by 
      the CytR repressor and positively affected by the cyclic AMP/catabolite activator 
      protein complex.

TI  - Helical phase dependent action of CRP: effect of the distance between the CRP 
      site and the -35 region on promoter activity.
PG  - 6325-30
AB  - A plasmid carrying a CRP-dependent promoter fused to the lac structural genes was 
      manipulated to construct a set of spacing mutants that have varying lengths 
      between the CRP binding site and the -35 region. The lengths of the spacer were 
      changed over 45 bp by inserting or deleting nucleotides. DNase I footprinting 
      analysis revealed that the spacer length did not affect the binding of cAMP-CRP 
      to the CRP site. The effect of the spacer length on transcription activation by 
      cAMP-CRP was tested in vivo by beta-galactosidase and quantitative S1 assays with 
      crp+ and delta crp cells harboring plasmids. Insertions or deletions of 
      non-integral helical turns, which displace the CRP site onto the opposite face of 
      DNA helix compared to the original promoter, eliminated completely the activation 
      of transcription. In contrast, changing the spacer length by integral helical 
      turns allowed the promoter to respond to CRP, although the degree of activation 
      varied with the length of the spacer. We conclude that stereospecific positioning 
      of CRP and RNA polymerase on the DNA helix is strictly required for CRP action. 
      The data support a model that CRP stimulates transcription by directly contacting 
      RNA polymerase.

TI  - Characterization of the Escherichia coli araFGH and araJ promoters.
PG  - 497-510
AB  - The identities of two cloned, arabinose-inducible promoters were tested by 
      hybridizing promoter DNA fragments with restriction digests of chromosomal DNA 
      containing Mudlac phage inserted in either araFGH or in araE transport operons. 
      One promoter, thought to be araE, is within 10(3) base-pairs of a Mudlac 
      insertion in the araE gene. The second promoter was not found within several 
      thousand base-pairs of either of the known transport genes. This promoter is now 
      named araPJ (araJ). The DNA sequence of the fragment containing the araFGH 
      promoter was determined. The start site of transcription in vivo was located to 
      within +/- 1 base-pair (bp) by S1 nuclease mapping. DNase 1 footprinting revealed 
      that, in comparison with the araBAD and araE promoters, the locations of the AraC 
      and cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) binding sites are reversed with CRP lying 
      between AraC and RNA polymerase. The central location of the CRP binding site may 
      explain why the araFGH promoter is more catabolite sensitive than the other ara 
      promoters. AraC and CRP were both required for maximal transcription in vitro, 
      although a low level of transcription was detected with CRP alone. S1 nuclease 
      mapping of mRNA-DNA hybrids from the araJ promoter located the transcription 
      start point to within #/- 3 bp, and demonstrates that the promoter is dependent 
      upon AraC protein and CRP in vivo. DNase footprinting showed that the location of 
      the AraC protein binding site on araJ is adjacent to the RNA polymerase site, as 
      seen at the araBAD and araE promoters. Two CRP sites were observed; one is 
      upstream from the AraC site and one is downstream from the transcription start 
      site.

TI  - The CytR repressor antagonizes cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP receptor protein activation 
      of the deoCp2 promoter of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 5706-13
AB  - We have investigated the regulation of the Escherichia coli deoCp2 promoter by 
      the CytR repressor and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) complexed to 
      cAMP. Promoter regions controlled by these two proteins characteristically 
      contain tandem cAMP-CRP binding sites. Here we show that (i) CytR selectively 
      regulated cAMP-CRP-dependent initiations, although transcription started from the 
      same site in deoCp2 in the absence or presence of cAMP-CRP; (ii) deletion of the 
      uppermost cAMP-CRP target (CRP-2) resulted in loss of CytR regulation, but had 
      only a minor effect on positive control by the cAMP-CRP complex; (iii) 
      introduction of point mutations in either CRP target resulted in loss of CytR 
      regulation; and (iv) regulation by CytR of deletion mutants lacking CRP-2 could 
      be specifically reestablished by increasing the intracellular concentration of 
      CytR. These findings indicate that both CRP targets are required for efficient 
      CytR repression of deoCp2. Models for the action of CytR are discussed in light 
      of these findings.

TI  - Tandem DNA-bound cAMP-CRP complexes are required for transcriptional repression 
      of the deoP2 promoter by the CytR repressor in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1595-601
AB  - We have studied the deoP2 promoter in Escherichia coli to define features 
      important for its interaction with the CytR repressor. As is characteristic for 
      CytR-regulated promoters, deoP2 encodes tandem binding sites for the activating 
      complex cAMP-CRP. One of these sites, CRP-1, overlaps the -35 region, and is 
      sufficient for activation; the second site, CRP-2, centred around -93, is 
      indispensable for repression. Here we demonstrate, by means of in vivo titration, 
      that CytR interaction with deoP2 depends not only on CRP-2, but also on CRP-1 and 
      the length and possibly the sequence separating these two sites. Also, point 
      mutations in either CRP site reduce or abolish CytR titration; however, no 
      co-operativity is observed in the interaction of CytR with the two CRP binding 
      sites. Furthermore, the reduction in CytR titration parallels the reduction in 
      binding of cAMP-CRP to the mutated CRP sites in vitro. These observations are not 
      easily explained by current models for the action of prokaryotic repressors; 
      instead we favour a model in which the interaction of CytR with deoP2 depends on 
      the presence of tandem DNA-bound cAMP-CRP complexes.

TI  - Stringent spacing requirements for transcription activation by CRP.
PG  - 733-43
AB  - The cyclic AMP receptor protein-cAMP complex (CRP-cAMP) binds at a variety of 
      distances upstream of several E. coli promoters and activates transcription. We 
      have constructed a model system in which a consensus CRP binding site is placed 
      at different distances upstream of the melR promoter. CRP-cAMP activates 
      transcription from melR when bound at a number of positions, all of which lie on 
      the same face of the DNA helix. The two distances at which transcription is 
      strongly activated correspond exactly to those at which CRP-cAMP binds upstream 
      of the well-studied galP1 and lac promoters. Footprinting of the synthetic 
      promoters reveals that RNA polymerase makes identical contacts with their -10 
      regions even though CRP-cAMP binds at a different distance in each case. Kinetic 
      analysis in vitro indicates that CRP-cAMP activates transcription from these 
      promoters in similar but distinct ways. A model is proposed to explain this 
      two-position activation.

TI  - Co-operative interactions between the catabolite gene activator protein and the 
      lac repressor at the lactose promoter.
PG  - 381-96
AB  - The catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) and the lac repressor regulate the 
      transcriptional activity of the lactose operon. An early step in the regulatory 
      functions of these proteins is their binding to specific DNA sequences within the 
      lac promoter-operator region. Using the gel electrophoresis mobility-shift 
      technique, we have found that the ternary complex with CAP and repressor bound to 
      their respective highest affinity sites is 4 to 11-fold more stable than is 
      predicted from the affinities of the independently bound proteins. This favorable 
      binding interaction is unexpected, because CAP and lac repressor exert opposing 
      effects on lac operon transcription. Deoxyribonuclease I footprinting analyses 
      show that interacting proteins remain bound to the sites occupied when the 
      proteins bind singly. These sites have a center-to-center separation of 72 
      base-pairs (corresponding to 6.9 turns of a B-form DNA helix), and thus occupy 
      the same "face" of the DNA cylinder. Such an orientation is compatible with 
      models of the ternary complex in which DNA curvature facilitates the interaction 
      of CAP and lac repressor.

TI  - Analysis of the regulatory region of the Escherichia coli nupG gene, encoding a 
      nucleoside-transport protein.
PG  - 547-51
AB  - The S1-mapping procedure, when applied to an 800-bp fragment upstream of the nupG 
      structural gene of Escherichia coli revealed one transcription-initiation site. 
      The corresponding promoter is negatively regulated by the cytR and the deoR 
      repressors. The expression of the gene is activated by the complex between cAMP 
      and its receptor protein. In strains lacking cAMP the promoter expression is 
      reduced and it is no longer regulated by the cytR repressor, whereas the deoR 
      regulation is retained.

TI  - Cloning and in vivo and in vitro regulation of cyclic AMP-dependent carbon 
      starvation genes from Escherichia coli.
PG  - 3813-20
AB  - The regulation of three Escherichia coli carbon starvation (cst) genes fused to 
      lacZ was examined. Expression of these genes is induced by starvation for a 
      carbon source. The role of carbon and cyclic AMP (cAMP) availability and of an 
      altered-function crp mutation were investigated for their effect on cst 
      expression in vivo. The experiments indicated that cAMP concentrations controlled 
      the absolute expression of one cst fusion, but the other two cst fusions were 
      dependent upon some component not present in exponentially growing cells under 
      conditions of glucose excess, even when cAMP was added. To examine the regulation 
      of these genes in further detail, the three cst::lacZ fusions were cloned on 
      multicopy plasmids. All three cst::lacZ fusions retained their inducible 
      regulatory phenotype in the multicopy state. Analysis of the expression of the 
      cloned cst::lacZ fusions in an in vitro-coupled transcription-translation 
      cell-free system demonstrated that the predominant promoter(s) present on each 
      cloned DNA was dependent on sigma 70 for expression. In vitro cAMP titration 
      curves indicated that this molecule was necessary and sufficient for the 
      expression of one fusion but not sufficient for the second fusion, while the 
      third fusion exhibited constitutive levels of expression in vitro. The results 
      are discussed in the context of the E. coli carbon starvation response.

TI  - Transcription and regulation of the cpdB gene in Escherichia coli K12 and 
      Salmonella typhimurium LT2: evidence for modulation of constitutive promoters by 
      cyclic AMP-CRP complex.
PG  - 161-5
AB  - Measurements of cyclic phosphodiesterase, or of beta-galactosidase in the case of 
      cpdB'-'lacZ fusions, indicate that cpdB expression in both Escherichia coli and 
      Salmonella typhimurium is modulated by carbon source availability, consistent 
      with previous observations in Salmonella. Nucleotide sequence analysis and 
      transcription mapping of both cpdB genes have revealed, in their 5' flanking 
      regions, sequences with good similarity to consensus -10 and -35 regions and 
      cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP receptor protein (cAMP-CRP) binding sites. Furthermore, 
      they are strongly conserved in both organisms. Deletion analysis of an E. coli 
      cpdB'-'lacZ fusion supports the identification of these elements, and a role for 
      the cAMP-CRP binding site in modulating constitutive cyclic phosphodiesterase 
      expression.

TI  - Activation of expression of the Escherichia coli cir gene by an iron-independent 
      regulatory mechanism involving cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP receptor protein complex.
PG  - 3529-33
AB  - Synthesis of the colicin I receptor protein, encoded by the cir gene, was 
      determined to be sensitive to control by the catabolite repression regulatory 
      system. Under both high- and low-iron conditions for growth, mutants unable to 
      produce cyclic AMP (cAMP) (cya) or functional cAMP receptor protein (crp) 
      exhibited decreased membrane levels of the receptor relative to those of the 
      wild-type strain. Exogenous addition of cAMP to the cya mutant restored maximal 
      expression. cAMP-dependent changes in steady-state levels of cir mRNA suggested 
      that the effect is mediated by control of transcript synthesis or stability. 
      Potential mechanisms for regulation were examined by deletion and sequence 
      analysis.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the heat shock regulatory gene rpoH in Escherichia 
      coli: involvement of a novel catabolite-sensitive promoter.
PG  - 2710-5
AB  - A catabolite-sensitive promoter was found to be involved in transcription of the 
      heat shock regulatory gene rpoH encoding the sigma 32 protein. Expression of lacZ 
      from the operon fusion, rpoHp-lacZ, was partially inhibited by glucose added to 
      the broth medium. Dissection of the rpoH promoter region allowed us to localize 
      the glucose-sensitive promoter to the 110-base-pair (bp) segment directly 
      upstream of the rpoH coding region. Experiments on lacZ expression from the set 
      of fusions in cya (adenylate cyclase) and crp (cyclic AMP [cAMP] receptor 
      protein) mutants also supported the involvement of a catabolite-sensitive 
      promoter. Analysis of rpoH mRNAs by S1 nuclease protection experiments led us to 
      identify a novel promoter, designated P5, that is regulated by cAMP and the cAMP 
      receptor protein. Studies of rpoH transcription in vitro demonstrated that RNA 
      polymerase-sigma 70 can transcribe from the P5 promoter only in the presence of 
      cAMP and its receptor protein. The 5' ends of P5 transcripts obtained in vivo and 
      in vitro were found to be at 61 to 62 bp upstream of the initiation codon, and a 
      putative binding sequence for the cAMP receptor protein was found at 38 to 39 bp 
      further upstream. Transcription from the P5 promoter is increased by the addition 
      of ethanol to the growth medium; however, the increase is greater in the presence 
      of glucose than in its absence. These results add a new dimension to the 
      transcriptional control of rpoH and to the regulation of the heat shock response 
      in Escherichia coli.

TI  - Structure and probable genetic location of a "ribosome modulation factor" 
      associated with 100S ribosomes in stationary-phase Escherichia coli cells.
PG  - 2657-61
AB  - The decrease in overall translation activity occurring concomitantly with the 
      transition from the exponential growth phase to the stationary phase of 
      Escherichia coli cells was found to be accompanied by the appearance of 100S 
      ribosomes (dimers of 70S ribosome monomers). Analysis of ribosomal proteins by 
      the radical-free and highly reducing method of two-dimensional gel 
      electrophoresis indicated that a protein, designated protein E, was exclusively 
      associated with 100S ribosomes. From the results, we propose that protein E is a 
      "ribosome modulation factor" (RMF), which associates with 70S ribosomes and 
      converts them to a dimeric form. A homology search of the partial amino acid 
      sequence of RMF using the DNA sequence data bases revealed that the rmf gene, 
      which encodes RMF, is located next to the fabA gene at 21.8 min on the E. coli 
      chromosome.

TI  - Cyclic AMP stimulates transcription of the structural gene of the outer-membrane 
      protein OmpA of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 307-11
AB  - To analyze the effect of cyclic AMP on the expression of the ompA gene of 
      Escherichia coli, encoding the outer-membrane protein OmpA, a fusion between this 
      gene and the lacZ gene was constructed in vitro by using a promoter-probe 
      plasmid. The results obtained indicated that the presence of glucose in the 
      culture medium decreased the transcription of the ompA gene. Likewise, cya and 
      crp mutants exhibited lower levels of ompA gene expression than the wild-type 
      strain. Furthermore, the addition of cyclic AMP increased the expression of the 
      ompA gene in both cya and wild-type strains but not in a crp mutant. All these 
      data show that the cyclic AMP receptor protein-cyclic AMP complex positively 
      modulates ompA transcription in E. coli K-12.

TI  - DNA looping in cellular repression of transcription of the galactose operon.
PG  - 410-8
AB  - Communication between distant DNA sites is a central feature of many DNA 
      transactions. Negative regulation of the galactose (gal) operon of Escherichia 
      coli requires repressor binding to two operator sites located on opposite sides 
      of the promoter. The proposed mechanism for regulation involves binding of the 
      repressor to both operator sites, followed by a protein-protein association that 
      loops the intervening promoter DNA (double occupancy plus association). To assess 
      these requirements in vivo, we have previously converted gal operator sites to 
      lac and shown that both operator sites must be occupied by the homologous 
      repressor protein (Lac or Gal) for negative regulation of the gal operon. We have 
      now addressed more directly the need for protein-protein association by the use 
      of the converted operator sites and a mutant Lac repressor defective in 
      association of the DNA-binding dimers. We have compared the biological and 
      biochemical activity of two Lac repressors: the wild-type (tetramer) I+ form, in 
      which the DNA-binding dimer units are tightly associated; and the mutant Iadi 
      repressor, in which the dimer units do not associate effectively. The I+ 
      repressor is an efficient negative regulator of the gal operon in vivo, but the 
      Iadi mutant is an ineffective repressor. Purified I+ repressor efficiently forms 
      DNA loops between operator sites that we have visualized by electron microscopy; 
      the Iadi repressor fails to form DNA loops, although the protein binds 
      effectively to both operator sites. From the clear correlation between looping in 
      vitro and repression in vivo, we conclude that regulation of the gal operon 
      depends on the association of repressor proteins bound to the two operator 
      sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the cytR repressor gene of Escherichia coli: 
      autoregulation and positive control by the cAMP/CAP complex.
PG  - 479-88
AB  - The Escherichia coli cytR-encoded repressor protein (CytR) controls the 
      expression of several genes involved in nucleoside and deoxynucleoside uptake and 
      metabolism. The cytR promoter was identified by determining the transcriptional 
      initiation site of the cytR gene. A chromosomal cytR-lacZ+ operon fusion was 
      isolated and used to study the regulation of cytR. We show that cytR expression 
      is negatively controlled by the CytR protein and positively affected by the 
      cAMP/CAP complex. Footprinting studies with purified CAP protein revealed two CAP 
      binding sites upstream of the cytR promoter. A previously described mutation 
      (cytR*) in the cloned cytR gene, which results in the phenotypic suppression of a 
      CytR operator mutation in the tsx P2 promoter, was analysed. DNA sequence 
      analysis of the cytR* mutation revealed a G-C to an A-T base pair transition at 
      position -34 bp relative to the translational initiation site of cytR. This point 
      mutation activates a cryptic promoter that is stronger than the wild-type cytR 
      promoter and leads to overproduction of the CytR repressor.

TI  - Consensus DNA site for the Escherichia coli catabolite gene activator protein 
      (CAP): CAP exhibits a 450-fold higher affinity for the consensus DNA site than 
      for the E. coli lac DNA site.
PG  - 10295-305
AB  - We have synthesized two 40 base pair DNA fragments; one fragment contains the 
      consensus DNA site for CAP (fragment 'ICAP'); the other fragment contains the E. 
      coli lac promoter DNA site for CAP (fragment 'LCAP'). We have investigated the 
      binding of CAP to the two DNA fragments using the nitrocellulose filter binding 
      assay. Under standard conditions [( NaCl] = 200 mM, pH = 7.3), CAP exhibits a 
      450-fold higher affinity for ICAP than for LCAP. The salt dependence of the 
      binding equilibrium indicates that CAP makes eight ion pairs with ICAP, but only 
      six ion pairs with LCAP. Approximately half of the difference in binding free 
      energy for interaction of CAP with ICAP vs. LCAP is attributable to this 
      difference in ion-pair formation. The pH dependence of the binding equilibrium 
      indicates that the eight CAP-ICAP ion pairs and the six CAP-LCAP ion pairs do not 
      involve His residues of CAP.

TI  - DNA sequence analysis of artificially evolved ebg enzyme and ebg repressor genes.
PG  - 635-48
AB  - The ebg system has been used as a model to study the artificial selection of new 
      catalytic functions of enzymes and of inducer specificities of repressors. A 
      series of mutant enzymes with altered catalytic specificities were previously 
      characterized biochemically as were the changes in inducer specificities of 
      mutant, but fully functional, repressors. The wild type ebg operon has been 
      sequenced, and the sequence differences of the mutant enzymes and repressors have 
      been determined. We now report that, contrary to our previous understanding, ebg 
      enzyme contains 180-kD alpha-subunits and 20-kD beta-subunits, both of which are 
      required for full activity. Mutations that dramatically affect substrate 
      specificity and catalytic efficiency lie in two distinct regions, both well 
      outside of the active site region. Mutations that affect inducer specificity of 
      the ebg repressor lie within predicted sugar binding domains. Comparisons of the 
      ebg beta-galactosidase and repressor with homologous proteins of the Escherichia 
      coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae lac operons, and with the galactose operon 
      repressor, suggest that the ebg and lac operons diverged prior to the divergence 
      of E. coli from Klebsiella. One case of a triple substitution as the consequence 
      of a single event is reported, and the implications of that observation for 
      mechanisms of spontaneous mutagenesis are discussed.

TI  - CRP/cAMP- and CytR-regulated promoters in Escherichia coli K12: the cdd promoter.
PG  - 1385-90
AB  - Transcriptional regulation of the deoP2 promoter by the cyclic AMP/cyclic AMP 
      receptor protein complex (cAMP/CRP) and the CytR repressor requires two 
      high-affinity CRP targets located around -41 and -93 bp preceding the start site 
      for transcription. Here we report the structure of cddP, another 
      CRP/CytR-regulated promoter. In common with what was found in deo, the cdd 
      promoter also contains multiple CRP targets. Thus, using the DNasel footprinting 
      procedure, tandem CRP binding sites were identified around -41 and -93. These 
      findings support a general model for CytR binding and CytR regulation, in which 
      (i) CytR and the CRP/cAMP complex bind to similar or identical targets, (ii) two 
      or more targets are necessary for proper binding of CytR to a promoter region, 
      and (iii) CytR represses transcription by antagonizing cAMP/CRP activation.

TI  - MalI, a novel protein involved in regulation of the maltose system of Escherichia 
      coli, is highly homologous to the repressor proteins GalR, CytR, and LacI.
PG  - 4888-99
AB  - The maltose regulon of Escherichia coli comprises several operons that are under 
      common regulatory control of the MalT activator protein. Five mal genes, 
      organized in two divergent operons, code for a binding-protein-dependent 
      transport system specific for maltose and maltodextrins. MalK, one of the 
      subunits of this transport system, not only is essential for transport but also 
      plays a role in regulation. Mutations abolishing MalK function not only result in 
      inability to transport maltose but also cause constitutive expression of the 
      maltose regulon. For this constitutivity to be exerted, the function of an 
      additional gene product, MalI, is necessary. Using the constitutive expression of 
      a malK-lacZ fusion as a signal, we cloned the malI gene, expressed it in 
      minicells, and determined its DNA sequence. The sequence predicted a protein of 
      34,729 molecular weight, in agreement with the apparent molecular weight of the 
      protein (35,000) when expressed in minicells and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis and autoradiography. MalI exhibited high homology to the 
      repressor proteins GalR, CytR, and LacI. When the amino acid sequences were 
      appropriately aligned, MalI showed 28% identity to GalR, 21% to CytR, and 24% to 
      LacI. Including conservative amino acid exchanges, these numbers increased to 69, 
      56, and 58%, respectively. The regions of high homology were clustered in 
      particular at the N-terminal portion of the protein that includes the 
      helix-turn-helix motif thought to be involved in DNA binding. The protein 
      contained a short stretch of 30 amino acids that was surprisingly homologous to a 
      sequence in MalT. The amino-terminal half of the protein exhibited significant 
      homology with MalK. The transcriptional start of malI was determined by reverse 
      transcriptase and by S1 nuclease mapping. We found a possible binding site for 
      cyclic AMP receptor protein in the promoter region of malI as well as two perfect 
      direct repeats of 14 base pairs with twofold symmetry indicating their possible 
      role as operator sites. Upstream to malI we observed a divergent open reading 
      frame that extended to the end of the sequenced DNA.

TI  - Single and double loop formation when deoR repressor binds to its natural 
      operator sites.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - Distal effects on the in vivo repression of the deo operon are thought to be 
      mediated by the deoR repressor with DNA loop formation. Such loops are easily 
      observed by electron microscopy when the oligomeric deoR repressor is added to a 
      DNA fragment carrying the three genetically defined operators at their 
      chromosomal distances. Upon binding of deoR to any two operators, single loops 
      are formed, 280, 600, and 880 bp in size. With the deo operon, double loops are 
      also formed, which are the combination of the 280 bp and 600 bp loops and the 
      result of simultaneous binding of the protein to its three sites. The formation 
      of both single and double loops is consistent with the long-range effects 
      observed in vivo and with the cooperative involvement of all three operator sites 
      in the repression.

TI  - Mapping of the Escherichia coli acid glucose-1-phosphatase gene agp and analysis 
      of its expression in vivo by use of an agp-phoA protein fusion.
PG  - 3511-7
AB  - The agp gene of Escherichia coli encodes an acid glucose-1-phosphatase, one of 
      the numerous phosphatases optimally active between pH 4 and 6 found in the 
      periplasmic space of this bacterium. An agp-phoA protein fusion linked to a gene 
      conferring kanamycin resistance was inserted into the chromosome in place of agp 
      by homologous recombination and was mapped to minute 22.6. Because the activity 
      of glucose-1-phosphatase cannot be measured accurately in whole cells, the 
      alkaline phosphatase activity of the agp-phoA hybrid protein was used to monitor 
      the expression of the chromosomal agp gene. The expression of agp was subject to 
      catabolite repression but was unaffected by the concentration of inorganic 
      phosphate in the growth medium. The product of the agp gene was required for 
      growth on glucose-1-phosphate as the sole carbon source, a function for which 
      alkaline phosphatase or other acid phosphatases cannot substitute.

TI  - Genetic regulation of glycogen biosynthesis in Escherichia coli: in vitro effects 
      of cyclic AMP and guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate and analysis of in vivo 
      transcripts.
PG  - 2773-82
AB  - Glycogen accumulation in Escherichia coli is inversely related to the growth rate 
      and occurs most actively when cells enter the stationary phase. The levels of the 
      three biosynthetic enzymes undergo corresponding changes under these conditions, 
      suggesting that genetic control of enzyme biosynthesis may account for at least 
      part of the regulation (J. Preiss, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 38:419-458, 1984). We 
      have begun to explore the molecular basis of this control by identifying factors 
      which affect the expression of the glycogen genes and by determining the 
      5'-flanking regions required to mediate the regulatory effects. The in vitro 
      coupled transcription-translation of two of the biosynthetic genes, glgC 
      (ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase) and glgA (glycogen synthase), was enhanced up to 
      26- and 10-fold, respectively, by cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP receptor protein 
      (CRP). Guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate stimulated the expression of these 
      genes 3.6- and 1.8-fold, respectively. The expression of glgB (glycogen branching 
      enzyme) was affected weakly or negligibly by the above-mentioned compounds. 
      Assays which measured the in vitro formation of the first dipeptide of glgC 
      showed that a restriction fragment which contained 0.5 kilobases of DNA upstream 
      from the initiation codon supported cAMP-CRP-activated expression. 
      Sequence-specific binding of cAMP-CRP to a 243-base-pair restriction fragment 
      from the region upstream from glgC was observed by virtue of the altered 
      electrophoretic mobility of the bound DNA. S1 nuclease protection analysis 
      identified 5' termini of four in vivo transcripts within 0.5 kilobases of the 
      glgC coding region. The relative concentrations of transcripts were higher in the 
      early stationary phase than in the exponential phase. Two mutants which 
      overproduced the biosynthesis enzymes accumulated elevated levels of specific 
      transcripts. The 5' termini of three of the transcripts were mapped to a high 
      resolution. Their upstream sequences showed weak similarity to the E. coli 
      consensus promoter. These results suggest complex transcriptional regulation of 
      the glycogen biosynthesis genes involving multiple promoter sites and direct 
      control of gene expression by at least two global regulatory systems.

TI  - Nucleoprotein structures at positively regulated bacterial promoters: homology 
      with replication origins and some hypotheses on the quaternary structure of the 
      activator proteins in these complexes.
PG  - 455-8
AB  - The quaternary structure of regulatory proteins undoubtedly plays an important 
      role in the initiation of transcription and DNA replication. To date, the 
      best-characterized regulatory proteins are oligomers in which promoters are bound 
      together by isologous interactions. From the examples presented in this article, 
      it appears that the formation of certain nucleoprotein complexes implicated in 
      transcription initiation might involve heterologous rather than isologous 
      interactions, allowing differentiation between two classes of transcription 
      activators. Nucleoprotein structures present at the oriC replication origin and 
      at malB promoters show striking homologies.

TI  - Protein phosphorylation and allosteric control of inducer exclusion and 
      catabolite repression by the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar 
      phosphotransferase system.
PG  - 109-20
AB  - The bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS) functions in a variety of 
      regulatory capacities. One of the best characterized of these is the process by 
      which the PTS regulates inducer uptake and catabolite repression. Early genetic 
      and physiological evidence supported a mechanism whereby the phosphorylation 
      state of an enzyme of the PTS, the enzyme III specific for glucose (IIIGlc), 
      allosterically inhibits the activities of a number of permeases and catabolic 
      enzymes, the lactose, galactose, melibiose, and maltose permeases, as well as 
      glycerol kinase. Extensive biochemical evidence now supports this model. Evidence 
      is also available showing that substrate binding to those target proteins 
      enhances their affinities for IIIGlc. In the case of the lactose permease, this 
      positively cooperative interaction represents a well documented example of 
      transmembrane signaling, demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. Although the 
      PTS-mediated regulation of cyclic AMP synthesis (catabolite repression) is not as 
      well defined from a mechanistic standpoint, a model involving allosteric 
      activation of adenylate cyclase by phospho-IIIGlc, together with the evidence 
      supporting it, is presented. These regulatory mechanisms may prove to be 
      operative in gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria, but the former 
      organisms may have introduced variations on the theme by covalently attaching 
      IIIGlc-like moieties to some of the target permeases and catabolic enzymes. It 
      appears likely that the general process of PTS-catalyzed protein 
      phosphorylation-dephosphorylation will prove to be important to the regulation of 
      numerous bacterial physiological processes, including chemotaxis, intermediary 
      metabolism, gene transcription, and virulence.

TI  - Cyclic-AMP-dependent switch in initiation of transcription from the two promoters 
      of the Escherichia coli gal operon: identification and assay of 5'-triphosphate 
      ends of mRNA by GTP:RNA guanyltransferase.
PG  - 1623-30
AB  - We have studied the initiation of transcription of the gal operon in Escherichia 
      coli (i) by analyzing the 5'-triphosphate ends and (ii) by measuring the level of 
      promoter-proximal gal mRNA made in vivo. The 5' termini were identified and 
      quantified by capping with GTP:mRNA guanyltransferase, and the mRNA levels were 
      determined by hybridization of pulse-labeled [32P]RNA with a specific DNA probe. 
      Our results conclusively demonstrate the in vivo activities of two promoters, P1 
      and P2, with separate initiation sites (S1 and S2) as suggested before from in 
      vitro and in vivo experiments (S. Adhya and W. Miller, Nature [London] 
      279:492-494, 1979; R. E. Musso, R. DiLauro, S. Adhya, and B. de Crombrugghe, Cell 
      12:847-854, 1977). We have also studied the effect of cyclic AMP (cAMP) on in 
      vivo gal transcription and found that whereas total gal transcription remains 
      largely unchanged, the relative proportions of the S1 and S2 mRNAs are influenced 
      by the level of cAMP in the cell. In strains devoid of cAMP (cya), transcription 
      initiates equally at S1 and S2; in cAMP-proficient cells (cya+), the S1 
      initiation increases twofold with a concomitant decrease in S2 initiation. 
      Addition of a saturating amount of exogenous cAMP to cya mutant cells results in 
      a relatively larger switch from S2 to S1. Our results clearly show that while 
      cAMP is an inhibitor of S2, it is not an absolute requirement for transcription 
      initiation at S1, but only acts to increase low-level transcription from the P1 
      promoter. Using these approaches, we have also studied gal promoter mutants 
      (P211, P18, and P35) which show altered behavior in transcription initiations and 
      in response to cAMP. On the basis of these results, we have discussed models by 
      which transcription initiates at the two overlapping gal promoters (P1 and P2) 
      and discussed how cAMP level modulates the switch between them.

TI  - A complex nucleoprotein structure involved in activation of transcription of two 
      divergent Escherichia coli promoters.
PG  - 471-85
AB  - Initiation of transcription at malEp and malKp, two divergent Escherichia coli 
      promoters, depends on the presence of both CRP, a pleiotropic activator, and 
      MalT, the maltose regulon activator. We carried out in vivo genetic and 
      functional analysis of these promoters and characterized their interaction with 
      MalT and CRP using DNase I footprinting. The functional limits of the promoters 
      are located about 240 base-pairs (bp) upstream of their transcription start 
      sites, which are 271 bp apart. These promoters therefore overlap by about 210 bp. 
      The overlapping region encompasses four CRP-binding sites and at least four 
      MalT-binding sites. Insertions in the centre of this region are tolerated 
      provided that they correspond to an integral number of DNA helix turns. In DNase 
      I footprinting experiments performed on the complex formed by MalT with 
      malEp-malKp, the DNA appears to be wrapped around the protein. We propose a model 
      for the nucleoprotein structure that might be involved in transcription 
      activation at these divergent promoters.

TI  - Effect of mutations in the cyclic AMP receptor protein-binding site on araBAD and 
      araC expression.
PG  - 1178-84
AB  - Maximum expression of the adjacent but divergently transcribed araBAD operon and 
      araC gene requires the presence of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the cAMP receptor 
      protein (CRP). DNase I protection studies have previously revealed a 
      high-affinity CRP-binding site in the ara regulatory region. Deletion mutations 
      introduced into this site resulted in reduced expression of araBAD and araC. 
      However, other experiments have demonstrated that spacing changes in the ara 
      regulatory region may have multiple effects due to disruption of a DNA loop. 
      Thus, the deletions could have destroyed the CRP-binding site, the ability to 
      form a loop, or both. In the present study, substitution mutations were 
      introduced into the CRP site in order to avoid creating spacing changes. We found 
      that a 3-base-pair substitution resulted in a 30% reduction in araBAD expression, 
      whereas a 6-base-pair substitution resulted in an 80% reduction. Both of these 
      substitution mutations reduced araC expression threefold. We conclude that CRP 
      bound to this site regulates expression in both directions. We found that a 
      spacing change in the CRP site does not alter araBAD expression any more than 
      does a substitution mutation.

TI  - Identification of a functional promoter for the Escherichia coli gdhA gene and 
      its regulation.
PG  - 233-46
AB  - Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) catalyzes the synthesis of L-glutamate from 
      2-oxoglutarate and ammonia. The complete nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia 
      coli gdhA gene, as well as its 5' and 3' flanking regions have been previously 
      reported [Valle et al., Gene 23 (1983) 199-209; 27 (1984) 193-199]. In this paper 
      we present data on the GDH specific activities using both excess and limiting 
      concentrations of ammonia as nitrogen sources. Evidence is presented on the 
      regulation of the mRNA levels for this enzyme by the ammonia concentration in the 
      growth medium. We have identified a single and apparently invariant transcript 
      for several metabolic growth conditions. We also report the identification of a 
      functional promoter and the corresponding transcription start point under several 
      growth conditions. Finally, possible regulatory sequences located at the 5' 
      flanking region of the gdhA gene are discussed.

TI  - Positive and negative regulators for glucitol (gut) operon expression in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 569-83
AB  - Expression of the glucitol (gut) operon in Escherichia coli is regulated by an 
      unusual, complex system which consists of an activator (encoded by the gutM gene) 
      and a repressor (encoded by the gutR gene) in addition to the cAMP-CRP complex 
      (CRP, cAMP receptor protein). The activator and repressor are predicted to 
      possess 119 (Mr = 12,955) and 257 (Mr = 28,240) aminoacyl residues, respectively, 
      as deduced from the nucleotide sequences of their structural genes. Both of the 
      genes encoding the two regulators are located downstream from the other known gut 
      structural genes. Reverse transcriptase mapping revealed that the gutM gene is a 
      promoter-distal constituent of the gut operon. The gutR gene has its own 
      promoter, but expression of this gene is primarily due to readthrough from the 
      gut operon operator-promoter. Thus, the gut operon consists of at least five 
      structural genes and has the following gene order: gutOPABDMR. Interestingly, 
      synthesis of the mRNA, which initiates at the promoter specific to the gutR gene, 
      occurs within the gutM gene. Expressional control of the gut operon appears to 
      occur as a consequence of the antagonistic action of the products of the 
      autogenously regulated gutM and gutR genes. An additional cistron of the gut 
      operon, of unknown function, may follow the gutR gene.

TI  - Transcription from the Escherichia coli melR promoter is dependent on the cyclic 
      AMP receptor protein.
PG  - 297-305
AB  - Expression of the melR gene is required for melibiose-dependent stimulation of 
      transcription initiation at the promoter of the melAB operon. Using the S1 
      nuclease method we have located the melR transcription start point. Transcription 
      from the melR promoter is dependent on cAMP-CRP: specific nucleotide sequences 
      downstream of bp -59 with respect to the melR transcription start are sufficient 
      for full promoter activity. Nucleotide sequence homologies suggest that the 
      cAMP-CRP binding site is located from bp -52 to -31, in exactly the same position 
      as at the galP1 promoter. Using DNase I footprinting we show that cAMP-CRP and 
      RNA polymerase together bind tightly to the melR promoter sequence, creating a 
      strong footprint from bp -70 to +20. Alone, cAMP-CRP binding is hardly 
      detectable, whereas RNA polymerase alone creates a weak footprint centred around 
      the -10 hexamer sequence. When the melR gene is expressed from a 
      cAMP-CRP-independent promoter, melibiose-dependent transcription from the melAB 
      promoter becomes independent of cAMP-CRP, showing that the melR promoter is the 
      primary site of control by cAMP-CRP in the mel regulon.

TI  - Structures of the promoter and operator of the glpD gene encoding aerobic 
      sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 4209-15
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 690-base-pair DNA segment containing the control 
      region for the glpD gene encoding aerobic sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
      was determined. An ATG translation initiation codon with an adjacent 
      ribosome-binding site was found which preceded an open reading frame continuing 
      61 codons to the end of the DNA that was sequenced. The start site for 
      transcription, identified by using primer extension analysis, was located 42 base 
      pairs upstream from the proposed Met start codon. The transcription start site 
      was preceded by a region containing typical -10 and -35 sequences found in 
      bacterial promoters. A binding site for the cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP receptor 
      protein complex (identified by comparison with the consensus-binding sequence and 
      verified by using DNase I footprinting) was located just upstream from the -35 
      sequence, centered at position -63. The interaction site for the glp repressor 
      was identified by using DNase I footprinting. It consisted of a 49-base-pair 
      region which started at the -10 sequence and continued to position +38. This 
      region contained two directly repeated sequences, each possessing hyphenated dyad 
      symmetry, which suggests that the operator is tandemly repeated. The presence of 
      two adjacent operators may explain why expression of the glpD gene is the most 
      sensitive to repressor when compared with expression of the other operons that 
      are members of the glp regulon.

TI  - The ptsH, ptsI, and crr genes of the Escherichia coli 
      phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system: a complex operon with 
      several modes of transcription.
PG  - 3827-37
AB  - The ptsH, ptsI, and crr genes, coding for three of the proteins of the 
      phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) (HPr, enzyme I, and 
      enzyme IIIGlc, respectively) have been studied by determination of their 
      nucleotide sequence and analysis of their expression. The three genes constitute 
      an operon, but analysis of the ptsH, ptsI, and crr transcripts by Northern (RNA) 
      blotting revealed the existence of three major mRNA species. One encompassed the 
      three cistrons, a second one the ptsH gene and part of the ptsI gene, and the 
      third one only the distal gene crr. The short crr transcripts were initiated 
      inside the ptsI open reading frame at points which were identified by S1 mapping. 
      Expression of the genes was studied in vivo by using operon and protein fusions 
      between the lacZ gene and the ptsH, ptsI, or crr gene on IncW low-copy-number 
      plasmids. The present study showed that (i) the ptsH, ptsI, and crr genes 
      exhibited high basal expression, (ii) transcription of the ptsH and ptsI genes 
      was stimulated threefold by the cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP receptor protein complex 
      and also by growth on glucose, but only in the presence of an active enzyme 
      IIGlc, (iii) crr-specific expression was not sensitive to the complex or to 
      growth on glucose, and (iv) under the growth conditions tested, the major part of 
      crr transcription was initiated from internal promoters.

TI  - Alternative DNA loops regulate the arabinose operon in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5444-8
AB  - The araCBAD regulatory region of Escherichia coli contains two divergently 
      oriented promoters and three sites to which AraC, the regulatory protein of the 
      operon, can bind. This paper presents the results of in vivo dimethyl sulfate 
      "footprinting" experiments to monitor occupancy of the three AraC sites and 
      measurements of activity of the two promoters. These measurements were made both 
      in the absence of the inducer arabinose and at various times after arabinose 
      addition to growing cells containing the wild-type ara regulatory region or the 
      regulatory region containing various deletions and point mutations. The data lead 
      to the conclusion that two different DNA loops can form in the ara regulatory 
      region. These loops are generated by AraC protein molecules binding to two 
      different DNA sites and binding to each other. One of these loops predominates in 
      the absence of arabinose and plays a major role in repressing activity of one of 
      the promoters. Upon the addition of arabinose the amount of the first loop type, 
      the repression loop, decreases and the amount of a second loop increases. 
      Formation of this second loop precludes the counterproductive formation of the 
      repression loop.

TI  - Cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP receptor protein as a repressor of transcription of the spf 
      gene of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 3110-4
AB  - The spf gene of Escherichia coli encodes an unstable 109-nucleotide RNA, spot 42 
      RNA; the level of this RNA was reduced three- to fivefold when cells were grown 
      in the presence of 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP). We show that this regulation occurs 
      through reduction in transcription and depends on both cAMP and the cAMP receptor 
      protein (CRP) but is independent of the de novo protein synthesis. Through 
      deletion analysis of the spf gene promoter, we have identified sequences that are 
      important in the synthesis of spot 42 RNA. Deletion of sequences upstream of -77 
      completely eliminated the negative control of cAMP-CRP and resulted in high 
      constitutive levels of transcription. This region contained a sequence that both 
      conformed to the consensus binding site for cAMP-CRP in positively regulated 
      promoters and acted as a cAMP-CRP binding site in a gel retardation assay. 
      Deletion of sequences between positions -77 and -60 greatly reduced the level of 
      transcription in the presence or absence of cAMP-CRP, indicating that at least 
      part of this region is a binding site for a positive-acting transcription factor 
      (or RNA polymerase itself). We propose that the proximity of the two sites 
      defined here allows for the negative control of spf gene transcription by 
      cAMP-CRP. In particular, if only one site at a time can be occupied, the binding 
      of cAMP-CRP would interfere with the binding of a transcription factor.

TI  - Fur (ferric uptake regulation) protein and CAP (catabolite-activator protein) 
      modulate transcription of fur gene in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 537-46
AB  - A fusion between the fur (ferric uptake regulation) gene, known to mediate 
      negative regulation of iron absorption in Escherichia coli, and lacZ was 
      constructed in vitro. beta-Galactosidase levels of cells harboring this fusion 
      were under the control of sequences contained in a 185-bp DNA fragment located 
      upstream of the fur structural gene. The fusion was prepared in multicopy 
      (pVLN102 plasmid) and low-copy-number states, the latter constructed as a lambda 
      phage lysogen carrying a fur'-'lacZ insert. DNase I footprinting experiments with 
      purified Fur protein, performed on a 250-bp restriction fragment carrying the 
      promoter region of the fusion, showed the presence of a single Fur-protected site 
      overlapping the -10 region of a potential promoter sequence. Examination of the 
      DNA sequences located upstream of the fur gene revealed a possible binding site 
      for the catabolite-activator protein (CAP). beta-Galactosidase synthesis of E. 
      coli cells harboring the fusion were measured in fur, crp and cya genetic 
      backgrounds and compared with the corresponding levels in wild-type strains. The 
      data obtained indicate a moderate autoregulation of fur expression by its gene 
      product and also a significant stimulation by the cAMP-CAP system. Transcription 
      start sites were mapped by primer-extension experiments with total RNA obtained 
      in vivo from cells harboring pVLN102. The results show that transcription of the 
      fur gene is initiated from at least two different sites separated by 6 bp, which 
      appear to originate from two overlapping promoters sensitive to catabolic 
      activation.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the mannitol (mtl) operon in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 405-12
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the known portions of the mannitol operon in 
      Escherichia coli (mtlOPAD) has been determined. Both the operator-promoter region 
      and the intercistronic region between the mtlA and mtlD genes (encoding the 
      mannitol-specific Enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system and 
      mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively) show parallels with 
      corresponding regions of the glucitol (gut) operon, but neither the mtlA nor the 
      mtlD gene products show obvious homology with the corresponding gene products of 
      the glucitol operon. Five potential cyclic AMP receptor protein binding sites 
      were identified in the mtlOP region, all showing near identity with the consensus 
      sequence. Four regions of dyad symmetry (four to seven bases in length), serving 
      as potential repressor binding sites, overlap with the potential cyclic AMP 
      receptor protein binding sites. Repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) 
      sequences, forming stem-loop structures in the intercistronic region between mtlA 
      and mtlD and following the mtlD gene were identified. Probable terminator 
      sequences were not found in any of these three regulatory regions. 
      Mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase exhibits two overlapping, potential NAD+ 
      binding sites near the N-terminus of the protein. Computer techniques were used 
      to analyse the mtlD gene and its product.

TI  - A mutant crp allele that differentially activates the operons of the fuc regulon 
      in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 2352-8
AB  - L-Fucose is used by Escherichia coli through an inducible pathway mediated by a 
      fucP-encoded permease, a fucI-encoded isomerase, a fucK-encoded kinase, and a 
      fucA-encoded aldolase. The adolase catalyzes the formation of dihydroxyacetone 
      phosphate and L-lactaldehyde. Anaerobically, lactaldehyde is converted by a 
      fucO-encoded oxidoreductase to L-1,2-propanediol, which is excreted. The fuc 
      genes belong to a regulon comprising four linked operons: fucO, fucA, fucPIK, and 
      fucR. The positive regulator encoded by fucR responds to fuculose 1-phosphate as 
      the effector. Mutants serially selected for aerobic growth on propanediol became 
      constitutive in fucO and fucA [fucO(Con) fucA(Con)], but noninducible in fucPIK 
      [fucPIK(Non)]. An external suppressor mutation that restored growth on fucose 
      caused constitutive expression of fucPIK. Results from this study indicate that 
      this suppressor mutation occurred in crp, which encodes the cyclic AMP-binding 
      (or receptor) protein. When the suppressor allele (crp-201) was transduced into 
      wild-type strains, the recipient became fucose negative and fucose sensitive 
      (with glycerol as the carbon and energy source) because of impaired expression of 
      fucA. The fucPIK operon became hyperinducible. The growth rate on maltose was 
      significantly reduced, but growth on L-rhamnose, D-galactose, L-arabinose, 
      glycerol, or glycerol 3-phosphate was close to normal. Lysogenization of fuc+ 
      crp-201 cells by a lambda bacteriophage bearing crp+ restored normal growth 
      ability on fucose. In contrast, lysogenization of 
      [fucO(Con)fucA(Con)fucPIK(Non)crp-201] cells by the same phage retarded their 
      growth on fucose.

TI  - Three binding sites for AraC protein are required for autoregulation of araC in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1749-53
AB  - Three binding sites for AraC protein were shown to be required for the 
      autoregulation of araC: araI1, araO1, and araO2. Selective inactivation of 
      AraC-binding sites on the DNA demonstrated that araO1 and araO2 are required in 
      vivo to produce repression of araC in the presence of arabinose, whereas araI1 
      and araO2 are required in its absence. We found that the low-affinity site araO2 
      is essential for araC autoregulation; araO1 and araI1 provide high-affinity 
      AraC-binding sites, which allow cooperative binding at araO2. Profound effects on 
      the araBAD promoter and the araC promoter are produced by ligand-induced changes 
      in AraC occupancy of functional sites on the DNA. We suggest that AraC exerts its 
      multiplicity of controls through two alternative states of cooperative 
      interactions with DNA and we illustrate this with a model. This model presents 
      our interpretations of activation and repression of the araBAD operon and the 
      autoregulation of the araC gene.

TI  - Regulation of ubiG gene expression in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1346-9
AB  - To study the regulation of the expression in Escherichia coli of the ubiG gene, 
      which codes for the last enzyme in the pathway of ubiquinone biosynthesis, a 
      fusion between the ubiG and lacZ genes was constructed in vitro. The results 
      showed that (i) the expression of the ubiG gene was higher under aerobic 
      conditions than under anaerobic growth conditions, (ii) the presence of glucose 
      in the culture medium decreased the transcription of the ubiG gene, and (iii) cya 
      and crp mutants exhibited lower levels of ubiG gene expression than the wild-type 
      strain. The addition of cyclic AMP increased the expression of the ubiG gene in 
      both cya and wild-type strains but not in a crp mutant. This fact suggests that 
      the cyclic AMP receptor protein-cyclic AMP complex positively modulates ubiG gene 
      transcription. It was also determined that the transcription of the ubiG gene was 
      in the counterclockwise direction on the E. coli map.

TI  - Nucleotide sequences of the Escherichia coli nagE and nagB genes: the structural 
      genes for the N-acetylglucosamine transport protein of the bacterial 
      phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system and for 
      glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase.
PG  - 197-207
AB  - The genes coding for the enzymes of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) uptake and 
      metabolism (nagA, nagB, and nagE) are located next to glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase 
      gene (glnS) in the Escherichia coli genome. We determined the nucleotide sequence 
      of the nagE (ptsN) gene, encoding the GlcNAc-specific enzyme II (NagE) of the 
      phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system, and the sequence of the 
      putative nagB gene, for glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase. S1 mapping identified 
      the mRNA transcript for nagE, indicating that nagE might be a sole constituent of 
      the nagE operon, and divergent transcripts which are probably of the nagB, nagA 
      genes. An evaluation of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of NagE shows 
      characteristics of a membrane protein. Also, NagE shows homologies to lactose 
      permease and to the glucose-specific transport protein (enzyme IIGlc), and the 
      glucose-specific phosphoryl carrier protein (enzyme IIIGlc). The latter two 
      homologies are particularly interesting since no enzyme III-like protein for 
      GlcNAc transport has been reported and enzyme IINag is of similar size as the 
      combined enzymes IIGlc plus IIIGlc. This supports the idea that these two 
      transport and phosphorylation systems may have evolved from a common ancestral 
      gene.

TI  - Double negative and positive control of tsx expression in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 108-16
AB  - The Escherichia coli tsx gene encodes an outer membrane protein that is involved 
      in nucleoside uptake and serves as the receptor protein for colicin K and several 
      bacteriophages. Regulation of its expression was studied by using tsx-lacZ 
      protein and operon fusion strains carrying mutations in deoR, cytR, and crp. The 
      cytR-encoded repressor had a stronger influence on tsx transcription than the 
      DeoR repressor did, and the level of tsx expression in a deoR cytR double mutant 
      was approximately the sum of those found in the single deoR and cytR strains. 
      This double negative control of Tsx synthesis was superceded by a positive 
      control mechanism mediated by the cyclic AMP-catabolite activator protein 
      (cAMP-CAP) complex. Our results suggest that tsx expression is controlled at two 
      separate and differently regulated promoters: the weaker promoter (P1) is 
      repressible by DeoR, while the stronger promoter (P2) is subject to negative and 
      positive control by the CytR repressor and the cAMP-CAP complex, respectively. A 
      mutant was isolated that showed unaltered tsx regulation by DeoR and the cAMP-CAP 
      complex but strongly reduced repression by CytR. This tsx operator mutant was 
      used to obtain a suppressor mutation located on a plasmid carrying the cloned 
      cytR gene that restored CytR control of tsx expression. The direction of tsx 
      transcription was determined and found to be counterclockwise on the E. coli 
      chromosome.

TI  - A new target for CRP action at the malT promoter.
PG  - 4227-34
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the transcription of the malT gene is activated by the 
      complex formed between cAMP and its receptor protein, CRP. Kinetics of formation 
      of polyribonucleotide products from the corresponding promoter were studied in 
      vitro by two sets of techniques, abortive initiation assays and run-off 
      experiments. The first type of assay indicated that open complexes were formed at 
      malT with an equivalent efficiency, and at comparable rates, whether CRP-cAMP was 
      present or not. Secondary effects due to the activating complex were observed 
      (increased stability of the open complex, elimination of a weaker binding site 
      for the enzyme, improved Michaelis constants of RNA polymerase for the substrates 
      of the assay, UTP in particular). But, primarily, CRP-cAMP did not exert a 
      significant role in the rate of formation of the initiation complex. In contrast, 
      run-off assays showed that the yield of the full-length transcripts was markedly 
      enhanced by prior incubation of the DNA fragment with CRP-cAMP. Both in the 
      presence and in the absence of activator, the rate-limiting step for this process 
      was markedly slower than the formation of the initial open complex. Short 
      oligonucleotides (n less than 9), probably arising from a recycling process, were 
      found when the initiation complex was formed in the absence of CRP-cAMP. They 
      were abolished by prior incubation with the activator. Unexpectedly, CRP-cAMP 
      appears to favour the escape of RNA polymerase from the initiation complex at 
      this promoter.

TI  - Arabinose-induced binding of AraC protein to araI2 activates the araBAD operon 
      promoter.
PG  - 8814-8
AB  - The state of Escherichia coli araI DNA occupancy by AraC protein has been found 
      to change from a two-turn to a four-turn occupancy upon the addition of the 
      inducer arabinose. The araI site is separable into two contiguous regions, araI1 
      and araI2. araI1 binds both ligand-bound and ligand-free AraC protein, whereas 
      araI2 binds AraC protein in the presence of arabinose only. A mutation in araI 
      and a known mutation in araC led to the loss of araI2 binding, while binding to 
      araI1 was unaffected. Both mutants failed to activate the promoter of the araBAD 
      operon. We propose that araI2 occupancy by AraC protein leads to RNA polymerase 
      recognition of the araBAD promoter and that araI1 acts as a switch mechanism 
      allowing both the repressor and the activator forms of AraC protein to regulate 
      the araBAD promoter.

TI  - Structure of a complex of catabolite gene activator protein and cyclic AMP 
      refined at 2.5 A resolution.
PG  - 311-26
AB  - The structure of a dimer of the Escherichia coli catabolite gene activator 
      protein has been refined at 2.5 A resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 
      20.7% starting with coordinates fitted to the map at 2.9 A resolution. The two 
      subunits are in different conformations and each contains one bound molecule of 
      the allosteric activator, cyclic AMP. The amino-terminal domain is linked to the 
      smaller carboxy-terminal domain by a nine-residue hinge region that exists in 
      different conformations in the two subunits, giving rise to approximately a 30 
      degree rotation between the positions of the small domains relative to the larger 
      domains. The amino-terminal domain contains an antiparallel beta-roll structure 
      in which the interstrand hydrogen bonding is well-determined. The beta-roll can 
      be described as a long antiparallel beta-ribbon that folds into a right-handed 
      supercoil and forms part of the cyclic AMP binding site. Each cyclic AMP molecule 
      is in an anti conformation and has ionic and hydrogen bond interactions with both 
      subunits.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of putP, the proline carrier gene of Escherichia coli K12.
PG  - 70-5
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the putP gene coding for the proline carrier in 
      Escherichia coli has been determined and the amino acid sequence of the proline 
      carrier deduced from it. The proline carrier is predicted to consist of 502 amino 
      acids, resulting in a molecular weight of 54,343. The predicted protein is very 
      hydrophobic (70% nonpolar amino acids), and its hydropathy profile suggests that 
      it is composed of 12 hydrophobic segments with a mean length of 24.4 
      residues/segment. If these segments are assumed to be alpha-helical, the mean 
      length of each domain corresponds to the thickness of the hydrophobic core of the 
      membrane. Potential promoter, catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) binding 
      sites and several palindromic sequences, which might be regulatory regions by the 
      putA gene product, were also found in the 5' flanking region of the postulated 
      putP gene. A typical rho-independent transcription termination signal was found 
      after the terminator codon of the putP gene.

TI  - Cloning and sequence of the mdh structural gene of Escherichia coli coding for 
      malate dehydrogenase.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - The malate dehydrogenase gene of Escherichia coli, which is susceptible to 
      catabolite and anaerobic repression, has been cloned using plasmic pLC32-38 of 
      Clarke and Carbon (1976). The nucleotide sequence was determined of a 2.47 kbp 
      fragment, containing the mdh structural gene. All information necessary for 
      expression of the mdh structural gene was mapped within a 1.3 kbp SphI-BstEII 
      fragment. Compared with the untransformed wild type, transformations with pUC19 
      vector, containing this fragment, gave up to 40-fold more malate dehydrogenase 
      activity in both E. coli wild type and mdh mutant recipients. Catabolite 
      repression was not affected in the transformants. A possible CRP binding site in 
      the promotor region of the mdh gene provides evidence for a co-regulation with 
      fumA gene, the structural gene of fumarase, which is also subject to catabolite 
      repression. The structures for transcription initiation and termination were 
      similar to those previously described for E. coli. Amino acid sequence homologies 
      between pro- and eucaryotic malate dehydrogenases are discussed.

TI  - Transcript analysis of the citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase genes of 
      Escherichia coli K12.
PG  - 3239-51
AB  - A transcript analysis of the citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase genes 
      (gltA-sdhCDAB) of Escherichia coli was done by nuclease S1 mapping. Evidence was 
      obtained for two monocistronic gltA transcripts extending anti-clockwise, to a 
      common terminus, from independent promoters with start points 196 bp (major) and 
      299 bp (minor) upstream of the gltA coding region. Evidence was also obtained for 
      two polycistronic sdh transcripts, sdhCDAB (minor) and sdhDAB (major), extending 
      clockwise, from sites 219 bp upstream of sdhC and 1455 bp upstream of sdhD (i.e. 
      within sdhC), to a common terminus. The synthesis of all of the transcripts was 
      repressed by growth in the presence of glucose, and this is consistent with the 
      well-established fact that both enzymes are subject to catabolite repression. 
      Sequences resembling known binding sites for the cAMP-CRP (cyclic AMP-cyclicAMP 
      receptor protein) complex occur in the vicinity of each promoter suggesting that 
      they are activated by the cAMP-CRP complex.

TI  - DNA-protein recognition: demonstration of three genetically separated operator 
      elements that are required for repression of the Escherichia coli deoCABD 
      promoters by the DeoR repressor.
PG  - 2015-21
AB  - The sequences required for full repression of the Escherichia coli deoP1 and P2 
      promoters by the deoR repressor (DeoR) have been analyzed in vivo. Using 
      recombinant techniques, we have constructed a set of deo-lacZ fusions which 
      contain different parts of the sequences involved in the regulation of deo 
      expression on low copy number fusion vectors. Since these vectors are present in 
      only one copy per chromosome at temperatures below 37 degrees C, this vector 
      system allows very accurate studies of gene control signals. Our results show 
      that three DeoR operator sites exist in the deoP1-P2 regulatory region. Two of 
      these loci overlap the initiation sites for deoP1 (O1) and deoP2 (O2) 
      transcription located 599 bp apart, whereas the third site (OE) is present 
      approximately 270 bp upstream of P1. DeoR repression of both P1 and P2 
      transcription is weak on promoter fragments which only contain one operator site 
      (O1 or O2). Enhanced repression by deoR is observed on promoter fragments 
      containing two operator sites. However, all three sites are needed for full 
      repression. These findings are discussed with respect to upstream and downstream 
      control regions of eukaryotic genes.

      K12.
PG  - 7652-8
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of rbsD, rbsA, and rbsC have been determined. These 
      genes encode components of the high affinity ribose transport system in 
      Escherichia coli, and together with the sequences of rbsB (Groarke, J.M., 
      Mahoney, W.C., Hope, J.N., Furlong, C.E., Robb, F.T., Zalkin, H., and Hermodson, 
      M.A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 12952-12956) and rbsK (Hope, J.N., Bell, A.W., 
      Hermodson, M.A., and Groarke, J.M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7663-7668), they 
      complete the nucleotide sequence of the first five genes of the rbs operon. 
      Nuclease S1 mapping places the transcriptional start site for the operon 29 base 
      pairs upstream from the most likely translational start site for rbsD. The open 
      reading frames of rbsD, rbsA, and rbsC encode proteins of 139, 501, and 321 amino 
      acid residues, respectively. The character of the proteins varies widely, from 
      very hydrophilic for the rbsA product to exceedingly hydrophobic for the rbsC 
      product. The intercistronic spaces between the three genes are very short, with 
      the stop codons of the upstream genes overlapping the ribosome-binding sites of 
      the downstream genes. This may imply translational control of expression of these 
      genes, the products of which presumably form a membrane-bound transport complex.

TI  - The regulatory region of the uxuAB operon in Escherichia coli K12.
PG  - 112-9
AB  - The uxuAB operon is composed of two genes coding for enzymes involved in 
      hexuronate degradation. This operon is negatively controlled by the uxuR and exuR 
      regulatory gene products. Starting from uxu hybrid plasmids, a 300 bp Sau3A 
      restriction fragment was isolated and shown to contain the entire uxu regulatory 
      region using in vitro gene fusions that brought lac gene expression under the 
      control of the transcriptional and translational signals of the uxuA gene. The 
      nucleotide sequence of this fragment was established. The start of the uxu mRNA 
      was localized by S1 mapping experiments (the presence of a CAP binding site 
      upstream of the promoter was shown by DNAse I footprinting and in vitro 
      titration). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified uxuA-lacZ gene 
      product allowed the mapping of the uxuA initiation codon at 115 bp from the start 
      of transcription.

TI  - Transcription of the speC (ornithine decarboxylase) gene of Escherichia coli is 
      repressed by cyclic AMP and its receptor protein.
PG  - 37-45
AB  - The speC gene encoding ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in Escherichia coli is 
      negatively regulated by cAMP and the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). In minicells 
      transformed with the plasmid pODC bearing speC, cAMP supplementation repressed 
      ODC synthesis. In a cell-free protein synthesizing system directed by pODC, cAMP 
      at 10(-5) M repressed ODC synthesis by 90%. This repression required a functional 
      CRP as cAMP failed to repress ODC synthesis in vitro in an extract prepared from 
      a crp- strain; the addition of purified CRP to the crp- extract restored the 
      ability of cAMP to repress ODC synthesis. In a prototroph transformed with the 
      plasmid pCOD bearing a speC::tet chimeric gene, cAMP supplementation decreased 
      tetracycline (Tc) resistance. In contrast, in crp- strains transformed with pCOD 
      or pTET (TcR), cAMP supplementation did not change their Tc resistance. When a 
      cya- strain was supplemented with 2 mM cAMP, steady state levels of ODC mRNA were 
      repressed by 80%. However, when a isogenic crp- strain was supplemented with 2 mM 
      cAMP, no repression of ODC mRNA was observed. These results indicate that the 
      cAMP-CRP complex exerts negative transcriptional control of ODC synthesis as a 
      function of the speC promoter.

TI  - Entry of RNA polymerase at the lac promoter.
PG  - 769-76
AB  - The pathway of RNA polymerase entry at the lac promoter was studied by 
      investigating the relationship between the promoter and a weak, overlapping 
      polymerase interaction site (P2). If polymerase is made to enter the DNA by 
      binding in vitro at this P2 site, cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) actively 
      removes polymerase and redirects it to the promoter. A template competition 
      experiment demonstrates that RNA polymerase initially bound at P2 does not slide 
      the 22 base pairs along the DNA from this "entry" site to the promoter, but must 
      locate the promoter by first leaving the template. We infer that CRP works by 
      binding DNA in a way that both clears the promoter and modifies it to assume a 
      form that is a better receptor for the binding of RNA polymerase from free 
      solution.

TI  - Evidence for transcription antitermination control of tryptophanase operon 
      expression in Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 731-40
AB  - Tryptophanase, encoded by the gene tnaA, is a catabolic enzyme distinct from the 
      enzymes of tryptophan biosynthesis. Tryptophanase synthesis is induced by 
      tryptophan and is subject to catabolite repression. We studied the mechanism of 
      tna operon induction. Mutants with altered rho factor were partially constitutive 
      for tna expression, implicating rho-dependent transcription termination in the 
      control of tna expression. Measurements of mRNA synthesis from the transcribed 
      leader region preceeding the tna operon suggested that the tna promoter was 
      constitutive and that in the absence of inducer, transcription terminated in the 
      leader region. Upon induction, this transcription termination was relieved. 
      Cis-acting constitutive mutants had genetic alterations in the tna leader region. 
      These lesions defined a site that is homologous to the bacteriophage lambda boxA 
      sequence, which is thought to play a role in antitermination control of lambda 
      lytic gene expression. We propose that tna expression is subject to transcription 
      antitermination control. We hypothesize that a tryptophan-activated 
      antiterminator protein mediates induction by suppressing the rho-dependent 
      termination sites in the leader region, thus allowing transcription to proceed 
      into the tna operon structural gene region.

TI  - Expression of glnA in Escherichia coli is regulated at tandem promoters.
PG  - 1979-83
AB  - We have determined that the glnA gene of the complex glnALG operon of Escherichia 
      coli is transcribed from tandem promoters. Expression from the upstream promoter, 
      glnAp1, requires the catabolite activating protein, is repressed by nitrogen 
      regulator I (NRI), the product of glnG, and produces a transcript with an 
      untranslated leader of 187 nucleotides. Expression from the downstream promoter, 
      glnAp2, requires NRI as well as the glnF product; full expression also requires 
      growth in a nitrogen-limited environment. The downstream transcript has an 
      untranslated leader of 73 nucleotides. We also provide evidence that the function 
      of the glnL product is to mediate the interconversion of NRI between a form 
      capable of activating glnAp2 and an inactive form in response to changes in the 
      intracellular concentration of ammonia. The function of the two minor promoters 
      of the glnALG operon, glnAp1 and glnLp, is to maintain the products of glnA, 
      glutamine synthetase, an essential enzyme, and of glnG, NRI, an activator of 
      nitrogen-controlled genes, during carbon-limited growth.

TI  - Transcription of the Escherichia coli adenylate cyclase gene is negatively 
      regulated by cAMP-cAMP receptor protein.
PG  - 3063-70
AB  - The regulatory region of the Escherichia coli cya gene was analyzed by using S1 
      nuclease mapping and in vitro transcription experiments. The cya gene was 
      transcribed, both in vivo and in vitro, from one major promoter (P2) and two weak 
      promoters (P1 and P1') that are located about 200 base pairs upstream of P2. The 
      transcription from P2 was specifically inhibited by cAMP-CRP (cAMP receptor 
      protein) in vitro. This regulatory mechanism was shown to be physiologically 
      relevant through quantitative analyses of the cya mRNA in intact cells by S1 and 
      dot blot assays. DNase I protection experiments revealed that cAMP-CRP binds to 
      the cya DNA region between +11 and -20, in which a consensus CRP binding sequence 
      is present. Moreover, it was found that cAMP-CRP alters the binding of RNA 
      polymerase to the promoter region, thus inhibiting the transcription of the cya 
      gene.

TI  - The use of gene fusions to study the expression of uidR, a negative regulatory 
      gene of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 159-67
AB  - The uidR regulatory gene of Escherichia coli codes for a repressor molecule that 
      negatively controls the expression of the uidA gene. The uidR gene was fused in 
      front of the lacZ gene in vitro on plasmid cloning vectors developed by Casadaban 
      et al. [J. Bacteriol. 143 (1980) 971-980. The transcriptional direction of uidR 
      was deduced from the restriction pattern and the phenotypic properties of the 
      uidR-lacZ fusion plasmids. The gene is transcribed counterclockwise on the 
      standard E. coli map, as is the uidA gene. The uidR-lacZ fusions were also used 
      to examine the regulation of expression from the uidR promoter. It was observed 
      that the uidR gene expression is repressed by its own product and is sensitive to 
      catabolite control. The uidR-lacZ-encoded proteins of various sizes were isolated 
      but attempts to obtain hybrid molecules possessing, in a single polypeptide, both 
      the beta-galactosidase and UidR repressor activities were unsuccessful.

AB  - A 1.6-kb MspI-HindIII chromosomal DNA segment, carrying the complete coding 
      region of the 6-phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) structural gene, manA, and the 5' 
      end of the gene encoding the major fumarase activity, fumA, of Escherichia coli 
      K-12, has been sequenced using the chain termination method. The start points of 
      manA and fumA transcripts were located by S1 mapping using 32P-labelled M13 ssDNA 
      probes, and the two genes were shown to be transcribed divergently. The sequence 
      of the 390 amino acid residues comprising the PMI monomer has been deduced, and 
      the predicted Mr of 42 716 agrees with that for the protein of Mr 42 000 
      identified previously by the maxicell procedure.

TI  - Interaction of cyclic AMP receptor protein with the ilvB biosynthetic operon in 
      E. coli.
PG  - 8145-60
AB  - DNase and restriction site protection studies show that cAMP and its receptor 
      protein (CRP) bind to the promoter of the ilvB operon at approximately position 
      -44 to -82. This region contains sequences that are homologous to those found in 
      other CRP-dependent promoters. In vitro transcription from the ilvB promoter was 
      markedly increased by the addition of cAMP and CRP. This stimulation was not 
      found when the ilvB template lacked the proposed CRP binding site. cAMP-CRP did 
      not alter the extent of transcription termination within the ilvB leader 
      suggesting that this regulatory system may be independent of the attenuation 
      mechanism involved in the negative control of this operon. The results of 
      restriction enzyme site protection studies and experiments with altered promoter 
      fragments indicate that the mechanism for CRP stimulation of the ilvB operon may 
      be similar to a model recently proposed for lac.

TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of the fumarase gene fumA, of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 3631-42
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.41 kb fragment of E. coli DNA containing the fumA 
      gene encoding fumarase was determined using the dideoxy chain termination method. 
      The initiation and termination sites of fumA transcription were located using 
      RNA:DNA hybridisation with single-stranded M13 probes. The length of the fumA 
      transcript was estimated as 1760 +/- 15 nucleotides and the fumA coding region of 
      1647 base pairs (549 codons) was identified. The deduced molecular weight of the 
      fumarase protein (Mr = 60163) is in good agreement with that of the protein 
      identified by the maxicell procedure. The DNA fragment also contains the 5' end 
      of the manA gene encoding mannose 6-phosphate isomerase, which is transcribed 
      with the opposite polarity to fumA .

TI  - Action of CAP on the malT promoter in vitro.
PG  - 1135-43
AB  - DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrated that CAP, the cyclic AMP receptor 
      protein of Escherichia coli, binds around position -70 at the promoter of malT, 
      the positive regulator gene of the maltose regulon. The binding of CAP in the 
      presence of cyclic AMP favored the subsequent specific binding of RNA polymerase. 
      Initiation of malT transcription in vitro displayed an absolute requirement for 
      CAP at all tested RNA polymerase concentrations. However this was not the case 
      with a mutant promoter (malTp1), which leads to CAP-independent malT expression 
      in vivo. In that case an effect of CAP was seen only at the lower concentrations 
      of RNA polymerase. These results, which suggest that CAP stimulates malT 
      expression by promoting the binding of polymerase to the promoter, are compared 
      with those obtained in other systems.

TI  - Mannitol-specific enzyme II of the bacterial phosphotransferase system. III. The 
      nucleotide sequence of the permease gene.
PG  - 10761-7
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the mtlA gene, which codes for the mannitol-specific 
      Enzyme II of the Escherichia coli phosphotransferase system, is presented. From 
      the gene sequence, the primary translation product is predicted to consist of 637 
      amino acids (Mr = 67,893). This result is compared to the amino acid composition 
      and molecular weight of the purified mannitol Enzyme II protein. The hydrophobic 
      and hydrophilic properties of the enzyme were evaluated along its amino acid 
      sequence using a computer program (Kyte, J., and Doolittle, R. F. (1982) J. Mol. 
      Biol. 157, 105-132). The computer analysis predicts that the NH2-terminal half of 
      the enzyme resides within the membrane, whereas the COOH-terminal half of the 
      enzyme has the properties of a soluble protein. The possible functions of such a 
      protein structure are discussed. RNA mapping has identified the promoter and mRNA 
      start point for the mtl operon.

      of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 715-20
AB  - A hypothesis for the regulation of some sugar transport systems by the bacterial 
      phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar transport system postulates an interaction between III 
      of this system and the carrier whose activity is regulated. We have studied this 
      interaction in more detail, employing one of these transport systems, the lactose 
      carrier of Escherichia coli. Purified III of the phosphotransferase system 
      interacted directly with the lactose carrier. The binding of III to lactose 
      carrier required the presence of the non-phosphorylated form of III and 
      substrates of the carrier and exhibited a stoichiometry of 1.2+/- 0.2 mol III/mol 
      lactose carrier. The K(d) of lactose carrier for III was 10 +/- 5 microM. III is 
      apparently unable to interact with a mutant lactose carrier which still binds but 
      does not transport galactosides. The binding of III to the lactose carrier 
      results in a 3.5-fold increase in the apparent affinity of galactosides for the 
      carrier. Significantly, the binding of III to the lactose carrier results in an 
      inhibition of galactoside translocation both in membrane vesicles and liposomes 
      reconstituted with the purified lactose carrier. This inhibition may thus be the 
      basis for the well-documented phenomenon of inducer exclusion.

TI  - Autoregulation of the Escherichia coli crp gene: CRP is a transcriptional 
      repressor for its own gene.
PG  - 141-9
AB  - The restriction fragments carrying the region preceding the Escherichia coli crp 
      structural gene were transcribed. The 5' end of the crp mRNA was determined by 
      RNAase partial digestion and S1 digestion methods. Thus the crp gene has been 
      shown to possess a 167 bp leader. CRP-cAMP specifically prevents the crp 
      transcription. In other words, the crp gene is regulated autogenously. DNAase 
      foot-printing studies indicated that CRP-cAMP binds to the crp gene at positions 
      +26 to +67. This region exhibits a striking sequence homology to the CRP-binding 
      sites in other genes. CRP and RNA polymerase bind to the crp regulatory region 
      simultaneously. These results suggest a different mechanism for transcriptional 
      repression of the crp gene by CRP-cAMP from that of a typical operator-repressor 
      model.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the ilvB promoter-regulatory region: a biosynthetic operon 
      controlled by attenuation and cyclic AMP.
PG  - 6156-60
AB  - The DNA sequence of the promoter-regulatory region of the ilvB operon of 
      Escherichia coli was determined. This region encodes a potential leader 
      polypeptide containing 32 amino acids, 12 of which are the regulatory amino acids 
      valine and leucine. Approximately 50 residues downstream from the coding region 
      for the potential leader peptide is a site for terminating transcription. In 
      vitro transcription experiments show that transcription terminates at this site 
      and produces a leader mRNA of approximately equal to 188 nucleotides. A model for 
      the multivalent regulation of this operon by valyl- and leucyl-tRNA is proposed 
      on the basis of the mutually exclusive formation of five strong stem-and-loop 
      structures in the leader mRNA. In addition, the -35 and -70 regions of this 
      sequence show close structural homologies to areas in cyclic AMP receptor protein 
      (CRP)-dependent promoters reported to be important for CRP function. In vitro 
      transcription from the ilvB promoter was greatly increased by cyclic AMP and CRP. 
      Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the ilvB biosynthetic operon is 
      negatively controlled by multivalent transcription termination and is positively 
      regulated by cyclic AMP and CRP.

TI  - Structure of catabolite gene activator protein at 2.9-A resolution. Incorporation 
      of amino acid sequence and interactions with cyclic AMP.
PG  - 9518-24
AB  - The amino acid sequence of the Escherichia coli catabolite gene activator protein 
      has been fit into a 2.9-A resolution electron density map. Each subunit of the 
      dimer consists of two structurally distinct domains. The larger NH2-terminal 
      domain is seen to bind cyclic AMP and forms all of the contacts between the 
      subunits. The cyclic AMP is completely buried between the interior of the "beta 
      roll" structure of the large domain and a long alpha helix; it makes important 
      hydrogen-bonding interactions with residues from both subunits. The guanidinium 
      group of a buried Arg makes an internal salt link with the phosphate of cyclic 
      AMP. The 6-amino group of adenine interacts simultaneously with both subunits. 
      This interaction with both subunits and the fact that cyclic GMP and cyclic IMP 
      do not activate catabolite gene activator protein suggest that the binding of 
      cyclic AMP may alter the relative orientation of the two subunits, which in turn 
      would change the structure of a DNA binding site that is presumed to span the two 
      smaller domains. The distribution and nature of side chains in the small domain 
      do not rule out the possibility that catabolite gene activator protein binds to 
      left-handed B-DNA.

TI  - Transcription initiation at the tryptophanase promoter of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 942-51
AB  - Restriction fragments containing the region preceding the tryptophanase 
      structural gene, tnaA, were used as templates for in vitro transcription 
      experiments. A transcription initiation site was detected that was dependent on 
      the catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) plus cyclic AMP (cAMP). The mRNA 
      produced in vitro was fingerprinted, and the nucleotide at which transcription 
      was initiated was localized to the vicinity of two guanine residues 316 and 318 
      base pairs upstream of tnaA. A region exhibiting extensive difold symmetry and 
      homology to the CAP binding site adjacent to the lactose operon promoter exists 
      approximately 60 base pairs preceding the site of transcription initiation. Two 
      HinfI restriction sites are located in this region. Restriction enzyme cleavage 
      at these sites was prevented when DNA containing the promoter region was 
      preincubated with CAP and cAMP. RNA polymerase was incapable of protecting these 
      sites against this cleavage. CAP and cAMP addition did not protect against 
      cleavage at a DdeI restriction site located in the -20 region of the promoter. 
      RNA polymerase did protect against DdeI cleavage but only in the presence of CAP 
      and cAMP. Thus, transcription initiation at the tryptophanase promoter involves 
      cAMP-dependent, CAP-facilitated binding of RNA polymerase to the DNA.

TI  - Use of in vitro gene fusions to study the uxuR regulatory gene in Escherichia 
      coli K-12: direction of transcription and regulation of its expression.
PG  - 1040-7
AB  - The uxuAB operon is composed of two genes coding for enzymes involved in 
      hexuronate degradation. This operon is negatively controlled by the uxuR and exuR 
      regulatory gene products. Fusions that brought lac gene expression under the 
      control of transcriptional and translational signals within the uxuR gene were 
      used to study uxuR regulation. These fusions were formed on plasmid cloning 
      vectors constructed by Casadaban et al. (J. Bacteriol. 143:971-980, 1980). The 
      transcriptional direction of the uxuR gene was deduced from the restriction 
      pattern and the phenotypic properties of the new plasmids. The gene is 
      transcribed counterclockwise on the standard Escherichia coli map, as is the 
      uxuAB operon. Introduction in trans of a compatible plasmid carrying a wild-type 
      uxuR gene in the lac fusion plasmid containing strain resulted in a decrease of 
      beta-galactosidase synthesis. It was concluded that expression of the uxuR gene 
      itself is repressed by its own product. The two other types of regulation found 
      in the uxuAB operon, i.e., induction by fructuronate and catabolite control, also 
      apply to the uxuR gene, whereas repression by the exuR repressor does not seem to 
      occur for the uxuR gene.

      enzyme III to the lactose permease.
PG  - 1457-61
AB  - Interaction between the glucose-specific enzyme III (enzyme IIIglc) of the 
      phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system and the lactose permease was 
      studied with membrane fragments from an Escherichia coli strain that overproduces 
      the lactose permease. Substrates of the permease markedly and specifically 
      stimulated binding of enzyme IIIglc to the membranes. The sugar-stimulated 
      binding of enzyme IIIglc was concluded to the specific to the lactose permease 
      because it (i) was dependent on the amount of the permease, (ii) was promoted 
      only by sugar substrates of the permease, and (iii) was completely eliminated by 
      treatment of the membranes with N-ethylmaleimide in the absence (but not the 
      presence) of thio-beta-D-digalactoside. The pH dependence of binding was similar 
      to that reported for the binding of thio-beta-D-digalactoside to the permease. 
      Phosphoenolpyruvate prevented the binding of enzyme IIIglc to the lactose 
      permease in the presence (but not the absence) of the other phosphate transfer 
      components of the phosphotransferase system. These results support the hypothesis 
      that enzyme IIIglc, in its dephosphorylated form, modulates the activity of the 
      lactose permease by a direct protein-protein interaction.

TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the gene for E. coli cAMP receptor 
      protein.
PG  - 1345-61
AB  - The crp gene of E. coli, which codes for cAMP receptor protein (CRP), has been 
      cloned in the plasmid pBR322 on the basis of a genetic complementation. One of 
      the recombinant plasmids, pHA1, was shown to direct the synthesis of CRP in a 
      cell-free system. The location of the crp gene was determined by constructing 
      subclones carrying various portions of pHA1. The nucleotide sequence of the crp 
      gene has been determined. The coding region consists of 627 base pairs (bp), 
      which specify a protein of 209 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence 
      from the DNA sequence is consistent with the amino acid sequence partially known 
      and the amino acid composition of CRP. After the coding region, there is a G-C 
      rich inverted repeat sequence followed by a run of Ts, which could be a 
      terminator of the crp gene. A possible promoter sequence was found about 180 bp 
      upstream from the initiation codon and was shown to act as a promoter in vitro 
      and in vivo. There are two dyad symmetry regions in a 167 bp leader sequence.

TI  - Regulation of lactose transport by the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar

PG  - 239-44
AB  - Regulation of lactose uptake by the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase 
      system (PTS) has been demonstrated in membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli 
      strain ML 308-225. Substrates of the phosphotransferase system inhibited 
      D-lactate energized uptake of lactose but did not inhibit uptake of either 
      L-alanine or L-proline. This inhibition was reversed by intravesicular (but not 
      extravesicular) phosphoenolpyruvate. Lactose uptake was also inhibited by enzyme 
      IIIglc preparations that were shocked into the vesicles, and this inhibition was 
      reversed by phosphoenolpyruvate. Intravesicular HPr and enzyme I stimulated 
      methyl alpha-glycoside uptake but did not inhibit or stimulate lactose 
      accumulation. Vesicles maintained at 0 degree C for several days partially lost 
      1) the ability to take up lactose, 2) the ability to accumulate PTS substrates, 
      and 3) PTS-mediated regulation. Phosphoenolpyruvate addition restored all of 
      these activities. These results support a mechanism in which the relative 
      proportions of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of a phosphotransferase 
      constituent regulate the activity of the lactose permease.

TI  - Tandem CRP binding sites in the deo operon of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 1049-54
AB  - The locations of DNA binding by the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) in the deo 
      operon of Escherichia coli have been determined by the DNase I footprinting 
      procedure. Two high affinity sites were found around positions -35 and -90, 
      preceding the second deo promoter. In vitro data on induction of gene fusions 
      that join different parts of the deoP -2 regulatory region to the lac genes 
      suggest that: (1) both CRP binding sites are needed for high expression from the 
      deoP -2 region; and (2) negative regulation by the cytR repressor is accomplished 
      by preventing the cAMP-CRP complex from binding to the second target.

TI  - Negative control of ornithine decarboxylase and arginine decarboxylase by 
      adenosine-3':5'-cyclic monophosphate in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 482-7
AB  - The polyamine biosynthetic enzymes, ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) (ODC) 
      and arginine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.19) (ADC), are negatively controlled by cAMP 
      in Escherichia coli. The specific activities of ODC and ADC were determined in 
      crude extracts prepared from E. coli strains carrying a mutation in the adenylate 
      cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) structural gene (cya) and wildtype strains. These strains 
      were cultured on various carbon sources in the presence and absence of cAMP. In 
      wild-type strains, ODC and ADC activities were diminished in cells grown on 
      glycerol compared to these strains cultured on glucose. When cya strains were 
      grown on glucose or glycerol, ODC and ADC activities were the same. Addition of 1 
      mM cAMP to glucose-based medium repressed ODC and ADC activities in both the 
      wild-type and cya strains. Furthermore, cAMP exerts its negative control through 
      the cAMP receptor protein, since strains carrying a mutation in the crp 
      structural gene fail to repress ODC and ADC activities in response to increased 
      cAMP obtained by carbon source manipulation or cAMP supplementation of the growth 
      medium. This evidence suggests that negative control of ODC and ADC by cAMP 
      occurs at the level of transcription.

TI  - Structure of catabolite gene activator protein at 2.9 A resolution suggests 
      binding to left-handed B-DNA.
PG  - 744-9
AB  - The 2.9 A resolution crystal structure of Escherichia coli catabolite gene 
      activator protein (CAP) complexed with cyclic AMP reveals two distinct structural 
      domains separated by a cleft. The smaller carboxy-terminal domain is presumed to 
      bind DNA while the amino-terminal domain is seen to bind cyclic AMP. Model 
      building studies suggest that CAP binds to left-handed B-type DNA, contracting 
      its major groove via two alpha-helices. It is possible that the CAP conversion of 
      right- to left-handed DNA in a closed supercoil, is what activates transcription 
      by RNA polymerase.

AB  - The wildtype lac promoter-operator region of E. coli was reinvestigated for 
      cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) binding sites using the 'footprinting' method. 
      Two distinct interaction sites were found, one in the -60 base pair region, which 
      has previously been described, and a second one covering the lac operator. These 
      two sites are similar in extent, orientation and the characteristic pattern of 
      CRP-induced DNaseI enhanced cutting sites.

TI  - Fine control of adenylate cyclase by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar 
      phosphotransferase systems in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.
PG  - 603-10
AB  - Inhibition of cellular adenylate cyclase activity by sugar substrates of the 
      phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system was reliant on the 
      activities of the protein components of this enzyme system and on a gene 
      designated crrA. In bacterial strains containing very low enzyme I activity, 
      inhibition could be elicited by nanomolar concentrations of sugar. An 
      antagonistic effect between methyl alpha-glucoside and phosphoenolpyruvate was 
      observed in permeabilized Escherichia coli cells containing normal activities of 
      the phosphotransferase system enzymes. In contrast, phosphoenolpyruvate could not 
      overcome the inhibitory effect of this sugar in strains deficient for enzyme I or 
      HPr. Although the in vivo sensitivity of adenylate cyclase to inhibition 
      correlated with sensitivity of carbohydrate permease function to inhibition in 
      most strains studied, a few mutant strains were isolated in which sensitivity of 
      carbohydrate uptake to inhibition was lost and sensitivity of adenylate cyclase 
      to regulation was retained. These results are consistent with the conclusions 
      that adenylate cyclase and the carbohydrate permeases were regulated by a common 
      mechanism involving phosphorylation of a cellular constituent by the 
      phosphotransferase system, but that bacterial cells possess mechanisms for 
      selectively uncoupling carbohydrate transport from regulation.

TI  - Cyclic AMP receptor protein of E. coli: its role in the synthesis of inducible 
      enzymes.
PG  - 480-7
AB  - A cyclic AMP binding protein has been purified over 100-fold from E. coli 
      extracts. Protein purified from wild-type strains binds cyclic AMP with an 
      apparent dissociation constant of 1-2 x 10(-6)M. Two mutant strains that are 
      unresponsive to exogenous cyclic AMP have altered binding activity; the protein 
      purified from one of these mutants has a decreased affinity for cyclic AMP 
      (apparent dissociation constant = 2 x 10(-5)M). Extracts of this mutant are 
      deficient in their ability to support beta-galactosidase synthesis in vitro. The 
      addition of purified, wild-type binding protein to these extracts restores enzyme 
      synthesis toward normal. Because this binding protein appears to be required for 
      cyclic AMP action, we suggest it be called the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CR 
      protein).

PG  - 104-10
AB  - Catabolite repression is defined as the inhibition of enzyme induction by glucose 
      or related substances. In the bacterium E. coli, the effect of glucose appears to 
      be due to a lowering of the cyclic AMP level. A DNA-directed cell-free system for 
      beta-galactosidase synthesis has served as a model system for studying the 
      mechanism of action of cyclic AMP. Previously, it was reported that in this 
      system cyclic AMP is required for normal initiation of mRNA synthesis. A protein 
      factor which acts in conjunction with the cyclic AMP has been partially purified. 
      This protein factor has a high affinity for cyclic AMP. These and other results 
      presented herein lead us to the conclusion that cyclic AMP and a protein factor 
      called the catabolite gene activator protein are part of a positive control 
      system for activating catabolite-sensitive genes.
