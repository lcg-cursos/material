TI  - Hfq protein and GcvB small RNA tailoring of oppA target mRNA to levels allowing 
      translation activation by MicF small RNA in Escherichia coli.

AB  - Traffic of molecules across the bacterial membrane mainly relies on porins and 
      transporters, whose expression must adapt to environmental conditions. To ensure 
      bacterial fitness, synthesis and assembly of functional porins and transporters 
      are regulated through a plethora of mechanisms. Among them, small regulatory RNAs 
      (sRNAs) are known to be powerful post-transcriptional regulators. In Escherichia 
      coli, the MicF sRNA is known to regulate only four targets, a very narrow 
      targetome for a sRNA responding to various stresses, such as membrane stress, 
      osmotic shock, or thermal shock. Using an in vivo pull-down assay combined with 
      high-throughput RNA sequencing, we sought to identify new targets of MicF to 
      better understand its role in the maintenance of cellular homoeostasis. Here, we 
      report the first positively regulated target of MicF, the oppA mRNA. The OppA 
      protein is the periplasmic component of the Opp ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 
      oligopeptide transporter and regulates the import of short peptides, some of them 
      bactericides. Mechanistic studies suggest that oppA translation is activated by 
      MicF through a mechanism of action involving facilitated access to a 
      translation-enhancing region in oppA 5'UTR. Intriguingly, MicF activation of oppA 
      translation depends on cross-regulation by negative trans-acting effectors, the 
      GcvB sRNA and the RNA chaperone protein Hfq.

AB  - As key players of gene regulation in many bacteria, small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) 
      associated with the RNA chaperone Hfq shape numerous phenotypic traits, including 
      metabolism, stress response and adaptation, as well as virulence. sRNAs can alter 
      target messenger RNA (mRNA) translation and stability via base pairing. sRNA 
      synthesis is generally under tight transcriptional regulation, but other levels 
      of regulation of sRNA signaling are less well understood. Here we used a 
      fluorescence-based functional screen to identify regulators that can quench sRNA 
      signaling of the iron-responsive sRNA RyhB in Escherichia coli The identified 
      regulators fell into two classes, general regulators (affecting signaling by many 
      sRNAs) and RyhB-specific regulators; we focused on the specific ones here. 
      General regulators include three Hfq-interacting sRNAs, CyaR, ChiX, and McaS, 
      previously found to act through Hfq competition, RNase T, a 3' to 5' exonuclease 
      not previously implicated in sRNA degradation, and YhbS, a putative GCN5-related 
      N-acetyltransferase (GNAT). Two specific regulators were identified. AspX, a 
      3'end-derived small RNA, specifically represses RyhB signaling via an RNA 
      sponging mechanism. YicC, a previously uncharacterized but widely conserved 
      protein, triggers rapid RyhB degradation via collaboration with the 
      exoribonuclease PNPase. These findings greatly expand our knowledge of regulation 
      of bacterial sRNA signaling and suggest complex regulatory networks for 
      controlling iron homeostasis in bacteria. The fluorescence-based genetic screen 
      system described here is a powerful tool expected to accelerate the discovery of 
      novel regulators of sRNA signaling in many bacteria.

TI  - Alteration of Transcriptional Regulator Rob In Vivo: Enhancement of Promoter DNA 
      Binding and Antibiotic Resistance in the Presence of Nucleobase Amino Acids.
PG  - 1217-1220
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00103 [doi]
AB  - The identification of proteins that bind selectively to nucleic acid sequences is 
      an ongoing challenge. We previously synthesized nucleobase amino acids designed 
      to replace proteinogenic amino acids; these were incorporated into proteins to 
      bind specific nucleic acids predictably. An early example involved selective cell 
      free binding of the hnRNP LL RRM1 domain to its i-motif DNA target via 
      Watson-Crick-like H-bonding interactions. In this study, we employ the X-ray 
      crystal structure of transcriptional regulator Rob bound to its micF promoter, 
      which occurred without DNA distortion. Rob proteins modified in vivo with 
      nucleobase amino acids at position 40 exhibited altered DNA promoter binding, as 
      predicted on the basis of their Watson-Crick-like H-bonding interactions with 
      promoter DNA A-box residue Gua-6. Rob protein expression ultimately controls 
      phenotypic changes, including resistance to antibiotics. Although Rob proteins 
      with nucleobase amino acids were expressed in Escherichia coli at levels 
      estimated to be only a fraction of that of the wild-type Rob protein, those 
      modified proteins that bound to the micF promoter more avidly than the wild type 
      in vitro also produced greater resistance to macrolide antibiotics roxithromycin 
      and clarithromycin in vivo, as well as the β-lactam antibiotic ampicillin. Also 
      demonstrated is the statistical significance of altered DNA binding and 
      antibiotic resistance for key Rob analogues. These preliminary findings suggest 
      the ultimate utility of nucleobase amino acids in altering and controlling 
      preferred nucleic acid target sequences by proteins, for probing molecular 
      interactions critical to protein function, and for enhancing phenotypic changes 
      in vivo by regulatory protein analogues.

AB  - Herein we introduce a high-throughput method, INTERFACE, to reveal the capacity 
      of contiguous RNA nucleotides to establish in vivo intermolecular RNA 
      interactions for the purpose of functional characterization of intracellular RNA. 
      INTERFACE enables simultaneous accessibility interrogation of an unlimited number 
      of regions by coupling regional hybridization detection to transcription 
      elongation outputs measurable by RNA-seq. We profile over 900 RNA interfaces in 
      71 validated, but largely mechanistically under-characterized, Escherichia coli 
      sRNAs in the presence and absence of a global regulator, Hfq, and find that 
      two-thirds of tested sRNAs feature Hfq-dependent regions. Further, we identify in 
      vivo hybridization patterns that hallmark functional regions to uncover mRNA 
      targets. In this way, we biochemically validate 25 mRNA targets, many of which 
      are not captured by typically tested, top-ranked computational predictions. We 
      additionally discover direct mRNA binding activity within the GlmY terminator, 
      highlighting the information value of high-throughput RNA accessibility data.

TI  - Small Regulatory RNAs in the Enterobacterial Response to Envelope Damage and 
      Oxidative Stress.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.RWR-0022-2018 [doi]
AB  - The ability of bacteria to thrive in diverse habitats and to adapt to 
      ever-changing environmental conditions relies on the rapid and stringent 
      modulation of gene expression. It has become evident in the past decade that 
      small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are central components of networks controlling the 
      bacterial responses to stress. Functioning at the posttranscriptional level, 
      sRNAs base-pair with cognate mRNAs to alter translation, stability, or both to 
      either repress or activate the targeted transcripts; the RNA chaperone Hfq 
      participates in stabilizing sRNAs and in promoting pairing between target and 
      sRNA. In particular, sRNAs act at the heart of crucial stress responses, 
      including those dedicated to overcoming membrane damage and oxidative stress, 
      discussed here. The bacterial cell envelope is the outermost protective barrier 
      against the environment and thus is constantly monitored and remodeled. Here, we 
      review the integration of sRNAs into the complex networks of several major 
      envelope stress responses of Gram-negative bacteria, including the RpoE (σ(E)), 
      Cpx, and Rcs regulons. Oxidative stress, caused by bacterial respiratory activity 
      or induced by toxic molecules, can lead to significant damage of cellular 
      components. In Escherichia coli and related bacteria, sRNAs also contribute 
      significantly to the function of the RpoS (σ(S))-dependent general stress 
      response as well as the specific OxyR- and SoxR/S-mediated responses to oxidative 
      damage. Their activities in gene regulation and crosstalk to other stress-induced 
      regulons are highlighted.

TI  - sRNA roles in regulating transcriptional regulators: Lrp and SoxS regulation by 
      sRNAs.
PG  - 6907-23
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkw358 [doi]
AB  - Post-transcriptional regulation of transcription factors contributes to 
      regulatory circuits. We created translational reporter fusions for multiple 
      central regulators in Escherichia coli and examined the effect of Hfq-dependent 
      non-coding RNAs on these fusions. This approach yields an 'RNA landscape,' 
      identifying Hfq-dependent sRNAs that regulate a given fusion. No significant sRNA 
      regulation of crp or fnr was detected. hns was regulated only by DsrA, as 
      previously reported. Lrp and SoxS were both found to be regulated 
      post-transcriptionally. Lrp, ' L: eucine-responsive R: egulatory P: rotein,' 
      regulates genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and catabolism and other 
      cellular functions. sRNAs DsrA, MicF and GcvB each independently downregulate the 
      lrp translational fusion, confirming previous reports for MicF and GcvB. MicF and 
      DsrA interact with an overlapping site early in the lrp ORF, while GcvB acts 
      upstream at two independent sites in the long lrp leader. Surprisingly, GcvB was 
      found to be responsible for significant downregulation of lrp after oxidative 
      stress; MicF also contributed. SoxS, an activator of genes used to combat 
      oxidative stress, is negatively regulated by sRNA MgrR. This study demonstrates 
      that while not all global regulators are subject to sRNA regulation, 
      post-transcriptional control by sRNAs allows multiple environmental signals to 
      affect synthesis of the transcriptional regulator.

AB  - As antibiotic resistance is increasingly becoming a public health concern, an 
      improved understanding of the bacterial DNA damage response (DDR), which is 
      commonly targeted by antibiotics, could be of tremendous therapeutic value. 
      Although the genetic components of the bacterial DDR have been studied 
      extensively in isolation, how the underlying biological pathways interact 
      functionally remains unclear. Here, we address this by performing systematic, 
      unbiased, quantitative synthetic genetic interaction (GI) screens and uncover 
      widespread changes in the GI network of the entire genomic integrity apparatus of 
      Escherichia coli under standard and DNA-damaging growth conditions. The GI 
      patterns of untreated cultures implicated two previously uncharacterized proteins 
      (YhbQ and YqgF) as nucleases, whereas reorganization of the GI network after DNA 
      damage revealed DDR roles for both annotated and uncharacterized genes. Analyses 
      of pan-bacterial conservation patterns suggest that DDR mechanisms and functional 
      relationships are near universal, highlighting a modular and highly adaptive 
      genomic stress response.

TI  - The Cpx envelope stress response regulates and is regulated by small noncoding 
      RNAs.
PG  - 4229-38
LID - 10.1128/JB.02138-14 [doi]
AB  - The Escherichia coli genome encodes approximately 30 two-component systems that 
      are required for sensing and responding to a variety of environmental and 
      physiological cues. Recent studies have revealed numerous regulatory connections 
      between two-component systems and small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs), which 
      posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression by base pairing with target mRNAs. 
      In this study, we investigated the role of sRNAs in the CpxAR two-component 
      system, which detects and mediates an adaptive response to potentially lethal 
      protein misfolding in the Gram-negative bacterial envelope. Here, we showed for 
      the first time that sRNAs are members of the Cpx regulon. We found that CpxR 
      binds to the promoter regions and regulates expression of two sRNA genes, cyaR 
      and rprA. We also investigated the roles that these sRNAs play in the Cpx 
      response. Cpx repression of cyaR expression creates a feed-forward loop, in which 
      CpxAR increases expression of the inner membrane protein YqaE both directly at 
      the transcriptional level and indirectly at the translational level. Moreover, we 
      found that RprA exerts negative feedback on the Cpx response, reducing Cpx 
      activity in a manner that is dependent on the response regulator CpxR but 
      independent of all of RprA's previously described targets. sRNAs therefore permit 
      the fine-tuning of Cpx pathway activity and its regulation of target genes, which 
      could assist bacterial survival in the face of envelope stress.

AB  - Studies on the regulatory RNA MicF in Enterobacteriaceae reveal a pivotal role in 
      gene regulation. Multiple target gene mRNAs were identified and, importantly, 
      MicF RNA regulates the expression of the global regulatory gene lrp (Holmqvist et

      regulatory network that regulates bacterial cell physiology.

AB  - Roughly 10% of all genes in Escherichia coli are controlled by the global 
      transcription factor Lrp, which responds to nutrient availability. 
      Bioinformatically, we identified lrp as one of several putative targets for the 
      sRNA MicF, which is transcriptionally downregulated by Lrp. Deleting micF results 
      in higher Lrp levels, while overexpression of MicF inhibits Lrp synthesis. This 
      effect is by antisense; mutations in the predicted interaction region relieve 
      MicF-dependent repression of Lrp synthesis, and regulation is restored by 
      compensatory mutations. In vitro, MicF sterically interferes with initiation 
      complex formation and inhibits lrp mRNA translation. In vivo, MicF indirectly 
      activates genes in the Lrp regulon by repressing Lrp, and causes severely 
      impaired growth in minimal medium, a phenotype characteristic of lrp deletion 
      strains. The double negative feedback between MicF and Lrp may promote a switch 
      for adequate Lrp-dependent adaptation to nutrient availability. Lrp adds to the 
      growing list of transcription factors that are targeted by sRNAs, thus indicating 
      that perhaps the majority of all bacterial genes may be directly or indirectly 
      controlled by sRNAs.

TI  - Role of the mar-sox-rob regulon in regulating outer membrane porin expression.
PG  - 2252-60
LID - 10.1128/JB.01382-10 [doi]
AB  - Multiple factors control the expression of the outer membrane porins OmpF and 
      OmpC in Escherichia coli. In this work, we investigated the role of the 
      mar-sox-rob regulon in regulating outer membrane porin expression in response to 
      salicylate. We provide both genetic and physiological evidence that MarA and Rob 
      can independently activate micF transcription in response to salicylate, leading 
      to reduced OmpF expression. MarA was also found to repress OmpF expression 
      through a MicF-independent pathway. In the case of OmpC, we found that its 
      transcription was moderately increased in response to salicylate. However, this 
      increase was independent of MarA and Rob. Finally, we found that the reduction in 
      OmpF expression in a tolC mutant is due primarily to Rob. Collectively, this work 
      further clarifies the coordinated role of MarA and Rob in regulating the 
      expression of the outer membrane porins.

TI  - The complexities of porin genetic regulation.
PG  - 24-36
LID - 10.1159/000274309 [doi]
AB  - Our understanding of porin regulation has revealed not only increasing complexity 
      in the regulatory mechanisms, but also that the porin repertoire is more 
      extensive than previously conceived. Initially, the OmpR response regulator was 
      described as the master regulator of porin genes, but many more regulators are 
      involved such as CpxR, PhoB, Lrp, Rob, MarA, SoxS, CadC, CRP, Fnr, ToxR, H-NS, 
      StpA, IHF, HU and LeuO. In addition to MicF, the first small RNA (sRNA) that was 
      proposed to regulate porin expression, porins are post-transcriptionally 
      regulated by a variety of other sRNAs, namely, MicC, MicA, IpeX, RseX, InvR, CyaR 
      and RybB. Future challenges include the full integration of all the regulatory 
      circuitries. Whether quiescent porins are merely replacements of the major porins 
      or are part of novel metabolic programs has yet to be elucidated. The 
      comprehensive exploration of the environmental determinants that affect porin 
      gene expression should yield valuable new information about the functions of 
      these important proteins.

TI  - Isolation of small RNA-binding proteins from E. coli: evidence for frequent 
      interaction of RNAs with RNA polymerase.
PG  - 30-40
AB  - Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression 
      enabling cells to adapt to various growth conditions. Assuming that most RNAs 
      require proteins to exert their activities, we purified and identified 
      sRNA-binding factors via affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. We 
      consistently obtained RNA polymerase betasubunit, host factor Hfq and ribosomal 
      protein S1 as sRNA-binding proteins in addition to several other factors. Most 
      importantly, we observed that RNA polymerase not only binds several sRNAs but 
      also reacts with them, both cleaving and extending the RNAs at their 3' ends. The 
      fact that the RNA polymerase reacts with sRNAs maps their interaction site to the 
      active centre cleft of the enzyme and shows that it takes RNAs as template to 
      perform RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. We further performed genomic SELEX 
      to isolate RNA polymerase-binding RNAs and obtained a large number of E. coli 
      sequences binding with high affinity to this enzyme. In vivo binding of some of 
      the RNAs to the RNA polymerase was confirmed via co-immunoprecipitation in cell 
      extracts prepared from different growth conditions. Our observations show that 
      RNA polymerase is able to bind and react with many different RNAs and we suggest 
      that RNAs are involved in transcriptional regulation more frequently than 
      anticipated.

TI  - Small RNA regulators and the bacterial response to stress.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Recent studies have uncovered dozens of regulatory small RNAs in bacteria. A 
      large number of these small RNAs act by pairing to their target mRNAs. The 
      outcome of pairing can be either stimulation or inhibition of translation. 
      Pairing in vivo frequently depends on the RNA-binding protein Hfq. Synthesis of 
      these small RNAs is tightly regulated at the level of transcription; many of the 
      well-studied stress response regulons have now been found to include a regulatory 
      RNA. Expression of the small RNA can help the cell cope with environmental stress 
      by redirecting cellular metabolism, exemplified by RyhB, a small RNA expressed 
      upon iron starvation. Although small RNAs found in Escherichia coli can usually 
      be identified by sequence comparison to closely related enterobacteria, other 
      approaches are necessary to find the equivalent RNAs in other bacterial species. 
      Nonetheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that many if not all bacteria 
      encode significant numbers of these important regulators. Tracing their evolution 
      through bacterial genomes remains a challenge.

PG  - 1018-37
AB  - Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are an emerging class of regulators of bacterial 
      gene expression. Most of the regulatory Escherichia coli sRNAs known to date 
      modulate translation of trans-encoded target mRNAs. We studied the specificity of 
      sRNA target interactions using gene fusions to green fluorescent protein (GFP) as 
      a novel reporter of translational control by bacterial sRNAs in vivo. Target 
      sequences were selected from both monocistronic and polycistronic mRNAs. Upon 
      expression of the cognate sRNA (DsrA, GcvB, MicA, MicC, MicF, RprA, RyhB, SgrS 
      and Spot42), we observed highly specific translation repression/activation of 
      target fusions under various growth conditions. Target regulation was also tested 
      in mutants that lacked Hfq or RNase III, or which expressed a truncated RNase E 
      (rne701). We found that translational regulation by these sRNAs was largely 
      independent of full-length RNase E, e.g. despite the fact that ompA fusion mRNA 
      decay could no longer be promoted by MicA. This is the first study in which 
      multiple well-defined E.coli sRNA target pairs have been studied in a uniform 
      manner in vivo. We expect our GFP fusion approach to be applicable to sRNA 
      targets of other bacteria, and also demonstrate that Vibrio RyhB sRNA represses a 
      Vibrio sodB fusion when co-expressed in E.coli.

TI  - Small non-coding RNAs and the bacterial outer membrane.
PG  - 605-11
AB  - Recent systematic genome searches revealed that bacteria encode a tremendous 
      number of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). Whereas most of these molecules remain 
      of unknown function, it has become increasingly clear that many of them will act 
      to modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Where studied in 
      more detail, sRNAs have often been found to control the expression of outer 
      membrane proteins (OMPs). Enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella 
      are now known to encode at least eight OMP-regulating sRNAs (InvR, MicA, MicC, 
      MicF, OmrAB, RseX and RybB). These sRNAs exert their functions under a variety of

TI  - Role of polyamines in formation of multiple antibiotic resistance of Escherichia 
      coli under stress conditions.
PG  - 1042-9
AB  - Under stress conditions, polyamines decreased the permeability of the outer 
      membrane of Escherichia coli. This effect is caused by at least three mechanisms 
      providing for an increase in the resistance to antibiotics transported through 
      porin channels (fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams): a positive modulation of the 
      gene micF transcription (its product antisense RNA inhibits the synthesis of 
      porin proteins on the translational level); a positive effect on the cell content 
      of the multiple stress resistance factor sigma(S) (it is accompanied by a 
      decrease in the porin transport because of suppression of ompF transcription and 
      induction of cadaverine synthesis); a direct inhibition of the transport activity 
      of porin channels. The production of cadaverine in E. coli cells significantly 
      increased in response to various antibiotics, and this was likely to be a 
      manifestation of oxidative stress.

TI  - Modulating the outer membrane with small RNAs.
PG  - 2338-48
AB  - MicF, one of the first chromosomally encoded regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) to be 
      discovered, was found to modulate the expression of OmpF, an abundant outer 
      membrane protein. Several recent papers have now shown that this is not an 
      isolated case. At least five other sRNAs also regulate the synthesis of outer 
      membrane porins, and additional sRNAs modulate the expression of other outer 
      membrane proteins. Here we review what is known about these sRNAs and discuss the 
      implications of this regulation.

TI  - The small RNA regulators of Escherichia coli: roles and mechanisms*.
PG  - 303-28
AB  - Small noncoding RNAs have been found in all organisms, primarily as regulators of 
      translation and message stability. The most exhaustive searches have taken place 
      in E. coli, resulting in identification of more than 50 small RNAs, or 1%-2% of 
      the number of protein-coding genes. One large class of these small RNAs uses the 
      RNA chaperone Hfq; members of this class act by pairing to target messenger RNAs. 
      Among the members of this class are DsrA and RprA, which positively regulate rpoS 
      translation, OxyS, which negatively regulates rpoS translation and fhlA 
      translation, RyhB, which reapportions iron use in the cell by downregulating 
      translation of many genes that encode Fe-containing proteins, and Spot 42, which 
      changes the polarity of translation in the gal operon. The promoters of these 
      small RNAs are tightly regulated, frequently as part of well-understood regulons. 
      Lessons learned from the study of small RNAs in E. coli can be applied to finding 
      these important regulators in other organisms.

TI  - MicC, a second small-RNA regulator of Omp protein expression in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 6689-97
AB  - In a previous bioinformatics-based search for novel small-RNA genes encoded by 
      the Escherichia coli genome, we identified a region, IS063, located between the 
      ompN and ydbK genes, that encodes an approximately 100-nucleotide small-RNA 
      transcript. Here we show that the expression of this small RNA is increased at a 
      low temperature and in minimal medium. Twenty-two nucleotides at the 5' end of 
      this transcript have the potential to form base pairs with the leader sequence of 
      the mRNA encoding the outer membrane protein OmpC. The deletion of IS063 
      increased the expression of an ompC-luc translational fusion 1.5- to 2-fold, and 
      a 10-fold overexpression of the small RNA led to a 2- to 3-fold repression of the 
      fusion. Deletion and overexpression of the IS063 RNA also resulted in increases 
      and decreases, respectively, in OmpC protein levels. Taken together, these 
      results suggest that IS063 is a regulator of OmpC expression; thus, the small RNA 
      has been renamed MicC. The antisense regulation was further demonstrated by the 
      finding that micC mutations were suppressed by compensatory mutations in the ompC 
      mRNA. MicC was also shown to inhibit ribosome binding to the ompC mRNA leader in 
      vitro and to require the Hfq RNA chaperone for its function. We suggest that the 
      MicF and MicC RNAs act in conjunction with the EnvZ-OmpR two-component system to 
      control the OmpF/OmpC protein ratio in response to a variety of environmental 
      stimuli.

TI  - Controlling mRNA stability and translation with small, noncoding RNAs.
PG  - 140-4
AB  - Recent studies have led to the identification of more than 50 small regulatory 
      RNAs in Escherichia coli. Only a subset of these RNAs has been characterized. 
      However, it is clear that many of the RNAs, such as the MicF, OxyS, DsrA, Spot42 
      and RyhB RNAs, act by basepairing to activate or repress translation or to 
      destabilize mRNAs. Basepairing between these regulatory RNAs and their target 
      mRNAs requires the Sm-like Hfq protein which most likely functions as an RNA 
      chaperone to increase RNA unfolding or local target RNA concentration. Here we 
      summarize the physiological roles of the basepairing RNAs, examine their 
      prevalence in bacteria and discuss unresolved questions regarding their 
      mechanisms of action.

TI  - Global analysis of small RNA and mRNA targets of Hfq.
PG  - 1111-24
AB  - Hfq, a bacterial member of the Sm family of RNA-binding proteins, is required for 
      the action of many small regulatory RNAs that act by basepairing with target 
      mRNAs. Hfq binds this family of small RNAs efficiently. We have used 
      co-immunoprecipitation with Hfq and direct detection of the bound RNAs on genomic 
      microarrays to identify members of this small RNA family. This approach was 
      extremely sensitive; even Hfq-binding small RNAs expressed at low levels were 
      readily detected. At least 15 of 46 known small RNAs in E. coli interact with 
      Hfq. In addition, high signals in other intergenic regions suggested up to 20 
      previously unidentified small RNAs bind Hfq; five were confirmed by Northern 
      analysis. Strong signals within genes and operons also were detected, some of 
      which correspond to known Hfq targets. Within the argX-hisR-leuT-proM operon, Hfq 
      appears to compete with RNase E and modulate RNA processing and degradation. Thus 
      Hfq immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis is a highly effective 
      method for detecting a major class of small RNAs as well as identifying new Hfq 
      functions.

TI  - Rice seedling whole exudates and extracted alkylresorcinols induce 
      stress-response in Escherichia coli biosensors.
PG  - 403-11
AB  - A set of Escherichia coli sensor strains was used to evaluate the stress exerted 
      on surrounding bacteria by germinating rice seed exudates. These biosensor 
      strains contain Vibrio fischeri luxCDABE genes fused to the promoters of 
      different genes involved in bacterial responses to environmental stresses. They 
      provided clear evidence for a stress exerted by rice exudates, as shown by the 
      induction of the universal stress protein gene uspA as well as genes of the heat 
      shock regulon, grpE, lon and dnaK. The oxidative stress gene katG, and the 
      post-transcriptional ompF regulator encoded by micF were also activated. The lack 
      of derepression of recA, uvrA and alkA indicated that damage to the DNA was not 
      induced in the E. coli strains tested. Interestingly, resorcinolic lipids 
      extracted from rice root seedlings induced the same promoters as whole exudates, 
      suggesting that these compounds may contribute to the stress exerted by seedling 
      exudates. The results obtained with E. coli biosensors thus indicate that, in 
      vivo, exudates may also exert a selective pressure on root-colonizing bacteria.

TI  - A bioinformatics based approach to discover small RNA genes in the Escherichia 
      coli genome.
PG  - 157-77
AB  - The recent explosion in available bacterial genome sequences has initiated the 
      need to improve an ability to annotate important sequence and structural elements 
      in a fast, efficient and accurate manner. In particular, small non-coding RNAs 
      (sRNAs) have been difficult to predict. The sRNAs play an important number of 
      structural, catalytic and regulatory roles in the cell. Although a few groups 
      have recently published prediction methods for annotating sRNAs in bacterial 
      genome, much remains to be done in this field. Toward the goal of developing an 
      efficient method for predicting unknown sRNA genes in the completed Escherichia 
      coli genome, we adopted a bioinformatics approach to search for DNA regions that 
      contain a sigma70 promoter within a short distance of a rho-independent 
      terminator. Among a total of 227 candidate sRNA genes initially identified, 32 
      were previously described sRNAs, orphan tRNAs, and partial tRNA and rRNA operons. 
      Fifty-one are mRNAs genes encoding annotated extremely small open reading frames 
      (ORFs) following an acceptable ribosome binding site. One hundred forty-four are 
      potentially novel non-translatable sRNA genes. Using total RNA isolated from E. 
      coli MG1655 cells grown under four different conditions, we verified transcripts 
      of some of the genes by Northern hybridization. Here we summarize our data and 
      discuss the rules and advantages/disadvantages of using this approach in 
      annotating sRNA genes on bacterial genomes.

TI  - Salicylate inhibits the translation and transcription of ompF in Escherichia 
      coli.
PG  - 1053-7
AB  - OmpF is a major outer membrane protein in Escherichia coli whose expression is 
      regulated by a large number of factors, including the osmolarity of the growth 
      medium and the concentration of salicylate. We have previously shown that at low 
      osmolarity, OmpF is post-transcriptionally regulated by micF mRNA, and that at 
      high osmolarity, regulation occurs primarily by the inhibition of transcription 
      by OmpR (Ramani et al. 1994). In contrast, salicylate was reported to alter OmpF 
      expression solely by blocking translation primarily through micF mRNA (Rosner et 
      al. 1991). We examined the effect of salicylate by analyzing the levels of OmpF 
      in wild-type and micF strains grown with salicylate. At low concentrations of 
      salicylate (0-4 mM), OmpF levels were inhibited strongly in wild-type cells, 
      whereas no inhibition of OmpF was observed in the micF strain. At high 
      concentrations of salicylate (10-20 mM), both the wild type and the micF strain 
      showed strong inhibition of OmpF. To study the effect of salicylate on 
      transcription, ompF mRNA and micF mRNA were analyzed in wild-type cells. micF 
      mRNA levels increased during growth with 1, 2, and 4 mM salicylate. In contrast, 
      ompF mRNA levels were not affected by low concentrations of salicylate, but 
      decreased strongly at 10 and 20 mM salicylate. Taken together, these results 
      suggest that similar to osmoregulation, salicylate inhibits both the translation 
      and transcription of ompF.

TI  - Structure and dynamics of MarA-DNA complexes: an NMR investigation.
PG  - 113-27
AB  - An unanswered question regarding gene regulation is how certain proteins are 
      capable of binding to DNA with high affinity at specific but highly degenerate 
      consensus sequences. We have investigated the interactions between the 
      Escherichia coli transcription factor, MarA, and its diverse binding sites using 
      NMR techniques. Complete resonance assignments for the backbone of the MarA 
      protein complexed with DNA oligomers corresponding to its binding sites at the 
      mar, fumC, micF and the fpr promoters were obtained. Secondary structure analysis 
      based on chemical shifts reveals that regions identified as helical in the X-ray 
      structure of the MarA-mar complex are present in the solution structure, although 
      some of the helices are less well defined. The chemical shift differences between 
      the four complexes confirm that helix 3 and helix 6 constitute the major 
      DNA-binding elements. However, in striking contrast with the X-ray data: (i) the 
      protein appears to be present in two or more conformations in each of the 
      complexes; (ii) no slowly exchanging N(zeta)H(2) protons (indicative of hydrogen 
      bonded groups) were observed by NMR for the two arginine residues proposed to 
      form crucial hydrogen bonds in the X-ray structure; and (iii) regions at the N 
      terminus, not observed in the X-ray structure, may be involved in DNA-binding. 
      Taken together, the NMR results indicate that MarA in its complexes with DNA 
      target sites is in a highly dynamic state, allowing for small but significant 
      rearrangements of the side-chains and/or backbone to bind to the different DNA 
      sequences.

TI  - MicF: an antisense RNA gene involved in response of Escherichia coli to global 
      stress factors.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - The micF gene is a stress response gene found in Escherichia coli and related 
      bacteria that post-transcriptionally controls expression of the outer membrane 
      porin gene ompF. The micF gene encodes a non-translated 93 nt antisense RNA that 
      binds its target ompF mRNA and regulates ompF expression by inhibiting 
      translation and inducing degradation of the message. In addition, other factors, 
      such as the RNA chaperone protein StpA also play a role in this regulatory 
      system. Expression of micF is controlled by both environmental and internal 
      stress factors. Four transcriptional regulators are known to bind the micF 
      promoter region and activate micF expression. The crystal structure of one these 
      transcriptional activators, Rob, complexed with the micF promoter has been 
      reported. Here, we review new developments in the micF regulatory network.

TI  - Activation of multiple antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic Escherichia coli 
      strains by aryloxoalcanoic acid compounds.
PG  - 1815-22
AB  - Clofibric and ethacrynic acids are prototypical pharmacological agents 
      administered in the treatment of hypertrigliceridemia and as a diuretic agent, 
      respectively. They share with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (the widely used 
      herbicide known as 2,4-D) a chlorinated phenoxy structural moiety. These 
      aryloxoalcanoic agents (AOAs) are mainly excreted by the renal route as unaltered 
      or conjugated active compounds. The relatedness of these agents at the structural 
      level and their potential effect on therapeutically treated or occupationally 
      exposed individuals who are simultaneously undergoing a bacterial urinary tract 
      infection led us to analyze their action on uropathogenic, clinically isolated 
      Escherichia coli strains. We found that exposure to these compounds increases the 
      bacterial resistance to an ample variety of antibiotics in clinical isolates of 
      both uropathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli strains. We demonstrate that the 
      AOAs induce an alteration of the bacterial outer membrane permeability properties 
      by the repression of the major porin OmpF in a micF-dependent process. 
      Furthermore, we establish that the antibiotic resistance phenotype is primarily 
      due to the induction of the MarRAB regulatory system by the AOAs, while other 
      regulatory pathways that also converge into micF modulation (OmpR/EnvZ, SoxRS, 
      and Lrp) remained unaltered. The fact that AOAs give rise to uropathogenic 
      strains with a diminished susceptibility to antimicrobials highlights the impact 
      of frequently underestimated or ignored collateral effects of chemical agents.

TI  - Hydrogen peroxide activates the SoxRS regulon in vivo.
PG  - 6842-4
AB  - By multiplex reverse transcription-PCR, we demonstrate that the SoxRS response, 
      which protects cells against superoxide toxicity, is triggered also by hydrogen 
      peroxide. SoxR-dependent inductions of 7. 3-, 7.6-, 4.6-, 2.2-, and 2.6-fold were 
      quantified for soxS, micF, sodA, inaA, and fpr transcripts, respectively. This 
      finding suggests an extensive and tight connectivity between different regulatory 
      pathways in the Escherichia coli response to oxidative stress.

TI  - A role for the Escherichia coli H-NS-like protein StpA in OmpF porin expression 
      through modulation of micF RNA stability.
PG  - 126-39
AB  - When a wild-type strain of Escherichia coli and its stpA, hns and stpA hns mutant 
      derivatives were compared by two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis, the 
      levels of expression of several proteins were found to vary. One of these was 
      identified as the outer membrane porin protein, OmpF. In the stpA hns double 
      mutant, the level of OmpF was downregulated dramatically, whereas in hns or stpA 
      single mutants, it was affected only slightly. Transcription from the ompF 
      promoter was reduced by 64% in the double mutant; however, the level of ompF mRNA 
      was reduced by 96%. This post-transcriptional expression was found to result from 
      a strong reduction in the half-life of ompF message in the double mutant. The 
      micF antisense RNA was shown to be involved in OmpF regulation by StpA using a 
      strain deleted for micF. Moreover, micF antisense RNA accumulated considerably in 
      an stpA hns background. Transcriptional data from a micF-lacZ fusion and 
      measurements of micF RNA half-life confirmed that this was caused by 
      transcriptional derepression of micF as a result of the hns lesion and increased 
      micF RNA stability due to the absence of StpA (a known RNA chaperone). These data 
      suggest a novel facet to the regulation of OmpF expression, namely 
      destabilization of micF RNA by StpA.

TI  - Defining a rob regulon in Escherichia coli by using transposon mutagenesis.
PG  - 3794-801
AB  - The Rob protein of Escherichia coli is a member of the AraC-XylS family of 
      prokaryotic transcriptional regulators and is expressed constitutively. Deletion 
      of the rob gene increases susceptibility to organic solvents, while 
      overexpression of Rob increases tolerance to organic solvents and resistance to a 
      variety of antibiotics and to the superoxide-generating compound phenazine 
      methosulfate. To determine whether constitutive levels of Rob regulate basal gene 
      expression, we performed a MudJ transposon screen in a rob deletion mutant 
      containing a plasmid that allows for controlled rob gene expression. We 
      identified eight genes and confirmed that seven are transcriptionally activated 
      by normal expression of Rob from the chromosomal rob gene (inaA, marR, aslB, 
      ybaO, mdlA, yfhD, and ybiS). One gene, galT, was repressed by Rob. We also 
      demonstrated by Northern analysis that basal expression of micF is significantly 
      higher in wild-type E. coli than in a rob deletion mutant. Rob binding to the 
      promoter regions of most of these genes was substantiated in electrophoretic 
      mobility shift assays. However, Mu insertions in individual Rob-regulated genes 
      did not affect solvent sensitivity. This phenotype may depend on changes in the 
      expression of several of these Rob-regulated genes or on other genes that were 
      not identified. Rob clearly affects the basal expression of genes with a broad 
      range of functions, including antibiotic resistance, acid adaptation, carbon 
      metabolism, cell wall synthesis, central intermediary metabolism, and transport. 
      The magnitudes of Rob's effects are modest, however, and the protein may thus 
      play a role as a general transcription cofactor.

TI  - Crystal structure of the Escherichia coli Rob transcription factor in complex 
      with DNA.
PG  - 424-30
AB  - The Escherichia coli Rob protein is a transcription factor belonging to the 
      AraC/XylS protein family that regulates genes involved in resistance to 
      antibiotics, organic solvents and heavy metals. The genes encoding these proteins 
      are activated by the homologous proteins MarA and SoxS, although the level of 
      activation can vary for the different transcription factors. Here we report a 2.7 
      A crystal structure of Rob in complex with the micF promoter that reveals an 
      unusual mode of binding to DNA. The Rob-DNA complex differs from the previously 
      reported structure of MarA bound to the mar promoter, in that only one of Rob's 
      dual helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs engages the major groove of the binding site. 
      Biochemical studies show that sequence specific interactions involving only one 
      of Rob's HTH motifs are sufficient for high affinity binding to DNA. The two 
      different modes of DNA binding seen in crystal structures of Rob and MarA also 
      match the distinctive patterns of DNA protection by AraC at several sites within 
      the pBAD promoter. These and other findings suggest that gene activation by 
      AraC/XylS transcription factors might involve two alternative modes of binding to 
      DNA in different promoter contexts.

TI  - Cationic peptide antimicrobials induce selective transcription of micF and osmY 
      in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 43-54
AB  - Cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as polymyxin and cecropin, activated 
      transcription of osmY and micF in growing Escherichia coli independently of each 
      other. The micF response required the presence of a functional rob gene. It is 
      intriguing that in this and other assays an identical response profile was also 
      seen with hyperosmotic salt or sucrose gradient, two of the most commonly used 
      traditional food preservatives. The osmY and micF transcription was not induced 
      by hypoosmotic gradient, ionophoric peptides, uncouplers, or with other classes 
      of membrane perturbing agents. The antibacterial peptides did not promote 
      transcription of genes that respond to macromolecular or oxidative damage, fatty 
      acid biosynthesis, heat shock, or depletion of proton or ion gradients. These and 
      other results show that the antibacterial cationic peptides induce stasis in the 
      early growth phase, and the transcriptional efficacy of antibacterial peptides 
      correlates with their minimum inhibitory concentration, and also with their 
      ability to mediate direct exchange of phospholipids between vesicles. The 
      significance of these results is developed as the hypothesis that the cationic 
      peptide antimicrobials stress growth of Gram-negative organisms by making 
      contacts between the two phospholipid interfaces in the periplasmic space and 
      prevent the hyperosmotic wrinkling of the cytoplasmic membrane. Broader 
      significance of these results, and of the hypothesis that the peptide mediated 
      contacts between the periplasmic phospholipid interfaces are the primary 
      triggers, is discussed in relation to antibacterial resistance.

TI  - Bile salt activation of stress response promoters in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 68-72
AB  - Bile salts are prevalent in the mammalian intestine, a natural habitat of 
      Escherichia coli. The bile salts deoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate, 
      ursodeoxycholate, and glycocholate were tested for their effect on induction of 
      13 specific stress response genes. The most consistently activated E. coli 
      promoters were those for genes micF, osmY, and dinD. MicF and osmY gene products 
      are associated with membrane functions and are responsive to oxidative stress. 
      DinD is induced by DNA damage as part of the SOS response. These results indicate 
      that bile acids, to which E. coli are naturally exposed, induce expression of 
      specific stress response genes, possibly in response to membrane perturbation, 
      oxidative stress, and DNA damage. Altered expression of stress-response genes may 
      also promote interaction of E. coli with cells of the colonic epithelium.

TI  - Natural antisense RNA/target RNA interactions: possible models for antisense 
      oligonucleotide drug design.
PG  - 751-3
AB  - Current antisense oligonucleotides designed for drug therapy rely on Watson-Crick 
      base pairing for the specificity of interactions between antisense and target 
      molecules. However, thermodynamically stable duplexes containing non-Watson-Crick 
      pairs have been formed with synthetic oligonucleotides. There are also numerous 
      examples of non-canonical base pairs that participate in stable intra- and 
      inter-molecular RNA/RNA pairing in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Several 
      natural antisense RNA/target RNA duplexes contain looped-out and bulged positions 
      as well as non-canonical pairs as exemplified by formation of the Escherichia 
      coli antisense micF RNA/ompF mRNA duplex. Secondary structures and the 
      phylogenetic conservation of nucleotide sequences are well characterized in this 
      system. Natural antisense/ target interactions may serve as models for 
      determining possible and optimal antisense/target interactions in oligonucleotide 
      drug design.

TI  - Alterations of the outer membrane composition in Escherichia coli lacking the 
      histone-like protein HU.
PG  - 6712-7
AB  - Escherichia coli cells lacking the histone-like protein HU form filaments and 
      have an abnormal number of anucleate cells. Furthermore, their phenotype 
      resembles that of rfa mutants, the well-characterized deep-rough phenotype, as 
      they show an enhanced permeability that renders them hypersensitive to 
      chloramphenicol, novobiocin, and detergents. We show that, unlike rfa mutants, 
      hupAB mutants do not have a truncated lipopolysaccharide but do have an abnormal 
      abundance of OmpF porin in their outer membrane. While the complete absence of HU 
      does not abolish the osmoregulation of OmpF protein synthesis, the steady-state 
      level of micF RNA, the negative regulator of OmpF, decreases in bacteria lacking 
      HU, increasing the basal level of this membrane protein. These findings 
      demonstrate a novel link between a bacterial chromosomal protein and the outer 
      membrane composition.

TI  - Unbalanced membrane phospholipid compositions affect transcriptional expression 
      of certain regulatory genes in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 2872-8
AB  - The amount of porin protein OmpF in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli was 
      reduced to one-third by the pgsA3 mutation that diminishes the amount of 
      phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin in the membrane, whereas a cls (cardiolipin 
      synthase) null mutation had no effect. Osmoregulation of OmpF was functional in 
      the pgsA3 mutant. As assessed by the beta-galactosidase activities of lacZ 
      fusions, the ompF expression was not reduced at the transcriptional level but was 
      reduced about threefold at the posttranscriptional level by pgsA3. This reduction 
      was mostly restored by a micF null mutation, and the micF RNA that inhibits the 
      ompF mRNA translation was present 1.3 to 1.4 times more in the pgsA3 mutant, as 
      assayed by RNase protection and Northern blot analyses. Elevation of the level of 
      micF RNA was not restricted to acidic-phospholipid deficiency: OmpF was hardly 
      detected and micF RNA was present 2.7 to 2.8 times more in a pssA null mutant 
      that lacked phosphatidylethanolamine. Other common phenotypes of pgsA3 and pssA 
      null mutants, reduced rates of cell growth and phospholipid synthesis, were not 
      the cause of micF activation. Salicylate, which activates micF expression and 
      inhibits cell motility, did not repress the flagellar master operon. These 
      results imply that an unbalanced phospholipid composition, rather than a decrease 
      or increase in the amount of specific phospholipid species, induces a 
      phospholipid-specific stress signal to which certain regulatory genes respond 
      positively or negatively according to their intrinsic mechanisms.

TI  - Antisense micF RNA and 5'-UTR of the target ompF RNA: phylogenetic conservation 
      of primary and secondary structures.
PG  - 33-5
AB  - Outer membrane protein F (OmpF) found in E. coli and related bacteria is 
      post-transcriptionally regulated by antisense micF RNA. During down regulation of 
      ompF expression, micF RNA binds to the 5' UTR of ompF mRNA, blocks translation of 
      the message, and also participates in the chemical destabilization of the ompF 
      mRNA. Only about one third of the micF RNA sequence binds the target ompF mRNA. 
      Phylogenetic analyses of micF RNA and ompF mRNA show: 1) a high degree of 
      conservation of nucleotide sequence in regions of both RNAs involved in RNA/RNA 
      interaction, 2) a low nucleotide sequence conservation but high degree of 
      secondary structure conservation in regions of antisense and target RNAs not 
      involved in the RNA/RNA interaction. Whereas conserved sequences are associated 
      with RNA/RNA binding and blockage of translation, conservation of secondary 
      structure may be related to protein interactions associated with chemical 
      destabilization of the message.

TI  - RobA-induced multiple antibiotic resistance largely depends on the activation of 
      the AcrAB efflux.
PG  - 697-702
AB  - RobA is a member of the XylS/AraC subfamily of DNA binding proteins, and when 
      overexpressed, it induces multiple antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli. In 
      this study, we introduced a multicopy robA plasmid (pMEP1) and its derivative 
      into OmpF mutants and an AcrAB-deficient mutant. We found that a decrease in 
      susceptibility to multiple antibiotics in these OmpF mutants when pMEP1 was 
      introduced did not depend on OmpF porin expression. Interestingly, a delta ompF 
      mutant (TK007) became more sensitive when pMEP1 was introduced. Moreover, no 
      effect of RobA on the induction of multiple antibiotic resistance in an acrA1- 
      mutant was observed. Therefore, we conclude that the multiple antibiotic 
      resistance induced by the overexpression of RobA largely depends on the 
      activation of the AcrAB efflux, as well as the activation of micF.

TI  - Hypochlorous acid activates the heat shock and soxRS systems of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 4003-8
AB  - A series of plasmids, containing fusions of different stress promoters to lux 
      reporter genes, was used in an attempt to monitor the defense circuits activated 
      upon exposure of Escherichia coli to sublethal doses of free chlorine. A 
      significant level of activation was exhibited by promoters of three heat shock 
      genes (grpE, dnaK, and lon), in an rpoH-dependent manner. The promoter of micF, a 
      gene under the control of the soxRS regulon, was also strongly induced, but not 
      in a soxR mutant. This induction was not affected by sodA and sodB mutations, 
      implying that it did not involve oxygen radical activity. Free-chlorine 
      activation of both heat shock and soxRS regulons required an exposure of less 
      then I s in duration. The oxyR or the SOS regulons were apparently not induced by 
      free chlorine (as judged by lack of activation of katG and recA, respectively), 
      and neither was the universal stress (uspA) protein.

TI  - Sequence specificity for DNA binding by Escherichia coli SoxS and Rob proteins.
PG  - 937-45
AB  - SoxS is a transcriptional activator of oxidative stress genes in Escherichia 
      coli. SoxS in vitro binds the promoters of soxRS-regulated genes such as micF, 
      zwf, nfo and sodA, forms multiple protein-DNA complexes, and recruits RNA 
      polymerase to the promoters. E. coli Rob protein, with an N-terminus 55% 
      identical to SoxS, was initially identified by its binding to the oriC 
      replication origin, but Rob in vitro binds some of the same promoters as SoxS and 
      in vivo activates some SoxS-regulated genes. In this work we show that the 
      multiple complexes with SoxS arise from the presence at least two independent 
      binding sites in each of the ++offcF and zwf promoters. SoxS and Rob each form 
      only a single complex with a 20 bp DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the 
      region immediately upstream of the -35 element of the micF promoter. Methylation 
      interference identified several conserved purine residues required for binding to 
      micF and five other SoxS-binding sites. Together with binding studies using 
      mutated ollgonucleotides and published DNase I footprinting data, this 
      information was used to form a consensus for SoxS sequence specificity: 
      AN2GCAYN7CWA (where N is any base, Y is a pyrimidine, and W is A or T). The 
      sequence requirements for Rob binding differed somewhat from those of SoxS. Using 
      the SoxS-binding consensus, several genes potentially regulated by soxRS were 
      identified in an E. coli genomic database; some of these genes have functions 
      that might contribute to cellular resistance to oxidative stress.

TI  - From acids to osmZ: multiple factors influence synthesis of the OmpF and OmpC 
      porins in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 911-7
AB  - In Escherichia coli, levels of the two major outer membrane porin proteins, OmpF 
      and OmpC, are regulated in response to a variety of environmental parameters, and 
      numerous factors have been shown to influence porin synthesis. EnvZ and OmpR 
      control porin-gene transcription in response to osmolarity, and the antisense 
      RNA, MicF, influences ompF translation. In contrast to these characterized 
      factors, some of the components reported to influence porin expression have only 
      modest effects and/or act indirectly. For others, potential regulatory roles, 
      although intriguing, remain elusive. Here we review many of the components that 
      have been reported to influence porin expression, address the potential 
      regulatory nature of these components, and discuss how they may contribute to a 
      regulatory network controlling porin synthesis.

TI  - H-NS regulates OmpF expression through micF antisense RNA in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 3650-3
AB  - H-NS is a major constituent of the Escherichia coli nucleoid. Expression of the 
      major outer membrane proteins, OmpC and OmpF, is influenced by hns mutations such 
      that OmpC expression increases whereas OmpF expression decreases irrespective of 
      the osmolarity of the medium (K. A. Graeme-Cook, G. May, E. Bremer, and C. F. 
      Higgins, Mol. Microbiol. 3:1287-1294, 1989). In this study we show that the 
      effect of an hns::neo mutation on OmpF expression is largely diminished in a 
      deletion mutant carrying the micF gene that encodes the ompF mRNA-specific 
      antisense RNA. In addition, the micF transcript levels in the hns::neo mutation 
      are high compared with transcript levels in wild-type cells. On the basis of 
      these results, we provide evidence for a link between OmpC/OmpF expression and 
      the regulatory function of H-NS. We suggest that H-NS most likely affects OmpC 
      expression directly at the level of transcription, but OmpF expression is 
      indirectly regulated by micF antisense RNA.

TI  - Transcriptional activation of promoters of the superoxide and multiple antibiotic 
      resistance regulons by Rob, a binding protein of the Escherichia coli origin of 
      chromosomal replication.
PG  - 2507-13
AB  - The Rob protein, isolated on the basis of its ability to bind to the right arm of 
      the Escherichia coli origin of chromosomal replication, is about 50% identical in 
      amino acid sequence to SoxS and MarA, the direct regulators of the superoxide 
      (soxRS) and multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) regulons, respectively. Having 
      previously demonstrated that SoxS (as a MalE-SoxS fusion protein) and MarA are 
      essentially identical in their abilities to activate in vitro transcription of 
      genes of the sox-mar regulons, we investigated the properties of Rob as a 
      transcriptional activator. We found that Rob (i) activates the transcription of 
      zwf,fpr,fumC, micF, nfo, and sodA, (ii) requires a 21-bp soxbox-marbox-robbox 
      sequence to activate zwf transcription, (iii) protects the soxbox/marbox/robbox 
      from attack by DNase 1, (iv) is ambidextrous, i.e., requires the C-terminal 
      domain of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase for activation of zwf but not fumC 
      or micF, (v) bends zwf and fumC DNA, and (vi) binds zwf and fumC DNA as a 
      monomer. Since these transcription activation properties of Rob are virtually 
      identical to those of MalE-SoxS and MarA, it appears as if the E. coli genome 
      encodes three genes with the same functional capacity. However, in contrast to 
      SoxS and MarA, whose syntheses are induced by specific environmental stimuli and 
      elicit a clear defense response, Rob is expressed constitutively and its normal 
      function is unknown.

PG  - 309-15
AB  - The ompC gene expression is induced by increasing temperature as well as osmotic 
      pressure. In this study, a mutant (TD2) defective in this thermoresponse was 
      isolated with transposon Tn10; the mutation was complemented by pMAN55 or pMAN56 
      containing micF and mapped at 48 min on Escherichia coli K-12. Furthermore, a new 
      gene (hrsA) that suppressed the mutation was cloned. Its nucleotide sequence was 
      analyzed and it was located close to the suc operon at 16.7 min corresponding to 
      #18F11 (Kohara bank) on E. coli genome. In TD2 containing the hrsA on a multicopy 
      plasmid, the ompC expression was induced and dependent on OmpR with increased 
      temperature. The HrsA was found to have Enzyme IIA, IIB, and IIC domains that are 
      homologous to Enzyme II, involved in the fructose-specific PTS 
      (phosphotransferase system). The putative phosphorylation sites (His87 and 
      Cys192) were also conserved in HrsA.

TI  - Ambidextrous transcriptional activation by SoxS: requirement for the C-terminal 
      domain of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit in a subset of Escherichia coli 
      superoxide-inducible genes.
PG  - 307-17
AB  - Purified MalE-SoxS fusion protein specifically stimulated in vitro transcription 
      of the Escherichia coli zwf, fpr, fumC, micF, nfo, and sodA genes, indicating 
      that activation of the superoxide regulon requires only SoxS. As in vivo, a 21 bp 
      sequence adjacent to the zwf promoter was able to activate transcription of an 
      heterologous promoter in vitro. Activation of zwf and fpr transcription required 
      the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit, while 
      stimulation of fumC, micF, nfo, and sodA transcription was independent of CTD 
      truncation. Thus, like the catabolite gene activator protein (CAP), SoxS is an 
      'ambidextrous' activator, activation only requiring the alpha CTD in a subset of 
      regulated promoters. Indeed, the -35 hexamers of the zwf and fpr promoters lie 
      downstream of the respective MalE-SoxS binding sites, while the binding sites of 
      fumC, micF, nfo, and sodA overlap their -35 promoter hexamers.

TI  - Purification and regulatory properties of MarA protein, a transcriptional 
      activator of Escherichia coli multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance 
      promoters.
PG  - 7100-4
AB  - Expression of the marA or soxS genes is induced by exposure of Escherichia coli 
      to salicylate or superoxides, respectively. This, in turn, enhances the 
      expression of a common set of promoters (the mar/soxRS regulons), resulting in 
      both multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance. Since MarA protein is highly 
      homologous to SoxS, and since a MalE-SoxS fusion protein has recently been shown 
      to activate soxRS regulon transcription, the ability of MarA to activate 
      transcription of these genes was tested. MarA was overexpressed as a 
      histidine-tagged fusion protein, purified, cleaved with thrombin (leaving one 
      N-terminal histidine residue), and renatured. Like MalE-SoxS, MarA (i) activated 
      the transcription of zwf, fpr, fumC, micF, nfo, and sodA; (ii) required a 21-bp 
      "soxbox" sequence to activate zwf transcription; and (iii) was "ambidextrous," 
      i.e., required the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase for 
      activation of zwf but not fumC or micF. Thus, the mar and soxRS systems use 
      activators with very similar specificities and mechanisms of action to respond to 
      different environmental signals.

AB  - Ribonuclease E (RNase E) is known to play an important role in mRNA decay and RNA 
      processing in Escherichia coli. While several substrates for RNase E have been 
      identified, the specificity for the recognition and cleavage sites has not been 
      completely determined. In this study, micF RNA, an antisense RNA found in E. coli 
      and related bacteria, was found to be a substrate for RNase E in vitro. Two 
      cleavage sites were mapped, and both are found in the sequence context UA/UUU and 
      are located within 10 nucleotides upstream of stem-loop structures. These results 
      help define a generalized RNase E cleavage/recognition pattern.

TI  - Activation of multiple antibiotic resistance and binding of stress-inducible 
      promoters by Escherichia coli Rob protein.
PG  - 1655-61
AB  - Multiple antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli can be mediated by induction 
      of the SoxS or MarA protein, triggered by oxygen radicals (in the soxRS regulon) 
      or certain antibiotics (in the marRAB regulon), respectively. These small 
      proteins (SoxS, 107 residues; MarA, 127 residues) are homologous to the C 
      terminus of the XylS-AraC family of proteins and are more closely related to a 
      approximately 100-residue segment in the N terminus of Rob protein, which binds 
      the right arm of the replication origin, oriC. We investigated whether the 
      SoxS-MarA homology in Rob might extend to the regulation of some of the same 
      inducible genes. Overexpression of Rob indeed conferred multiple antibiotic 
      resistance similar to that known for SoxS and MarA (against chloramphenicol, 
      tetracycline, nalidixic acid, and puromycin), as well as resistance to the 
      superoxide-generating compound phenazine methosulfate. The Rob-induced antibiotic 
      resistance depended only partially on the micF antisense RNA that down-regulates 
      the OmpF outer membrane porin to limit antibiotic uptake. Similar antibiotic 
      resistance was conferred by expression of a Rob fragment containing only the 
      N-terminal 123 residues that constitute the SoxS-MarA homology. Both intact Rob 
      and the N-terminal fragment activated expression of stress genes (inaA, fumC, 
      sodA) but with a pattern distinct from that found for SoxS and MarA. Purified Rob 
      protein bound a DNA fragment containing the micF promoter (50% bound at 
      approximately 10(-9) M Rob) as strongly as it did oriC, and it bound more weakly 
      to DNA containing the sodA, nfo, or zwf promoter (50% bound at 10(-8) to 10(-7) 
      M). Rob formed multiple DNA-protein complexes with these fragments, as seen 
      previously for SoxS. These data point to a DNA-binding gene activator module used 
      in different protein contexts.

TI  - Secondary structures of Escherichia coli antisense micF RNA, the 5'-end of the 
      target ompF mRNA, and the RNA/RNA duplex.
PG  - 3621-31
AB  - The Escherichia coli micF RNA is a prototype for a class of antisense RNAs 
      encoded by genes at different loci from those that code for their target RNAs. 
      RNAs in this class exhibit only partial complementarity to their targets. micF 
      RNA binds to and regulates the stability of ompF mRNA in response to a variety of 
      environmental stimuli. The secondary structures of micF RNA, ompF-213 mRNA (a 
      segment containing the 213 nucleotides at the 5'-terminus of the target message), 
      and the micF RNA/ompF-213 mRNA duplex were analyzed in vitro by partial digestion 
      with structure-specific ribonucleases and chemical modification. Both micF RNA 
      and ompF mRNA have single-stranded 5'-ends and contain stable stem-loop 
      structures. Strong phylogenetic support for the proposed secondary structure for 
      E. coli micF RNA is provided by a comparison of structural models derived from 
      micF sequences from related bacteria. The micF RNA/ompF-213 mRNA duplex 
      interaction appears to involve only a short segment of micF RNA. Unfolding of 
      only one stem-loop of micF RNA and a minor stem-loop of ompF-213 mRNA appears to 
      be necessary to form the duplex. The probing data suggest that the Shine-Dalgarno 
      sequence and AUG start codon of ompF mRNA, found in single-stranded regions in 
      the free message, are base-paired to micF RNA in the RNA/RNA duplex.

TI  - Regulation of gene expression by trans-encoded antisense RNAs.
PG  - 411-4
AB  - Members of a class of antisense RNAs are encoded by genes that are located at 
      loci other than those of their target genes. Three examples of antisense RNA 
      genes are discussed here. micF is found in Escherichia coli and other bacteria 
      and functions to control outer membrane protein F levels in response to 
      environmental stimuli. dicF is also found in E. coli and is involved in the 
      regulation of cell division. lin-4 is found in the nematode Caenorhabditis 
      elegans and functions during larval development. Nucleotide sequences of at least 
      two of these genes appear to be phylogenetically conserved. The trans-encoded 
      antisense RNAs are small RNAs which display only partial complementarity to their 
      target RNAs. Models for RNA/RNA interactions have been proposed. It is possible 
      that currently known unlinked antisense RNA genes are part of a larger class of 
      heretofore undiscovered regulatory RNA genes. Possible ways of detecting other 
      unlinked antisense RNA genes are discussed.

TI  - The leucine-responsive regulatory protein of Escherichia coli negatively 
      regulates transcription of ompC and micF and positively regulates translation of 
      ompF.
PG  - 103-13
AB  - The two major porins of Escherichia coli K-12 strains, OmpC and OmpF, are 
      inversely regulated with respect to one another. The expression of OmpC and OmpF 
      has been shown to be influenced by the leucine-responsive regulatory protein 
      (Lrp): two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins from strains with and 
      strains without a functional Lrp protein revealed that OmpC expression is 
      increased in an lrp strain, while OmpF expression is decreased. In agreement with 
      these findings, we now present evidence that transcriptional (operon) fusions of 
      lacZ+ to ompC and micF are negatively regulated by Lrp. Lrp binds specifically to 
      the intergenic region between micF and ompC, as indicated by mobility shift 
      assays and by DNase I footprinting. The expression of an ompF'-lacZ+ gene 
      (translational) fusion is increased 3.7-fold in an lrp+ background compared with 
      an lrp background, but expression of an ompF-lacZ+ operon fusion is not. Studies 
      of in vivo expression of the outer membrane porins during growth on glucose 
      minimal medium showed that the OmpF/OmpC ratio is higher in lrp+ strains than it 
      is in isogenic lrp strains. The effect of Lrp was not seen in a strain containing 
      a deletion of micF. Our studies suggest that the positive effect of Lrp on OmpF 
      expression stems from a negative effect of Lrp on the expression of micF, an 
      antisense RNA that inhibits ompF translation.

TI  - Purification of a MalE-SoxS fusion protein and identification of the control 
      sites of Escherichia coli superoxide-inducible genes.
PG  - 669-79
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the soxRS genes effect the cell's defence against superoxide 
      by activating the transcription of more than 14 genes, including zwf, sodA, nfo, 
      micF and fumC. Previous work from other laboratories has indicated that SoxR is 
      the sensor of oxidative stress and induces synthesis of SoxS, which in turn 
      activates transcription of the regulon's target genes. Although SoxS appears to 
      be a DNA-binding protein, its ability to bind to the promoter regions of target 
      genes has not been demonstrated. To facilitate purification and characterization 
      of SoxS, we constructed a fusion of soxS to malE, which encodes maltose-binding 
      protein, and demonstrated that the in vivo expression of the MalE-SoxS fusion 
      protein can provide SoxS function to a soxRS deletion mutant. We purified the 
      fusion protein by affinity chromatography on an amylose column. The purified 
      fusion protein stimulated in vitro expression of zwf in a coupled 
      transcription-translation system and formed specific complexes with DNA fragments 
      carrying target gene promoters. Moreover, MalE-SoxS protected from DNase I attack 
      22-27 bp segments immediately adjacent to or overlapping the -35 hexamers of the 
      zwf, sodA, nfo, micF, and fumC promoters. The protected regions revealed a 
      consensus 'soxbox' sequence.

AB  - micF RNA, produced from a multicopy plasmid, was originally shown to be a major 
      factor in negative osmoregulation of the OmpF outer membrane protein in 
      Escherichia coli. However, subsequent experiments with a micF deletion strain 
      suggested that chromosomal micF RNA was not a key component in this process. We 
      report here that micF RNA is essential for the reduction in OmpF levels in cells 
      grown in media of low-to-intermediate levels of osmolarity. Under these 
      conditions, the amount of OmpF was reduced up to 60% in the parent strain while 
      OmpF levels were not altered in the micF deletion mutant. In medium of higher 
      osmolarity, OmpF synthesis was strongly inhibited in both strains. RNA 
      measurements showed that micF RNA levels rose rapidly in cells grown in 
      low-to-intermediate levels of osmolarity concomitant with the reduction in OmpF 
      protein, while ompF mRNA decreased strongly only during high-osmolarity 
      conditions. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the negative 
      osmoregulation of OmpF at low-to-intermediate osmolarity levels requires micF RNA 
      and that this is masked at higher osmolarity by the known strong inhibition of 
      OmpF transcription by OmpR. Results consistent with this model were also obtained 
      by using procaine, a compound reported to inhibit ompF expression by a mechanism 
      very similar to that involved in osmoregulation.

TI  - SoxS, an activator of superoxide stress genes in Escherichia coli. Purification 
      and interaction with DNA.
PG  - 18371-7
AB  - A genetic response of Escherichia coli to nitric oxide or to 
      superoxide-generating agents such as paraquat is controlled by the soxRS locus. 
      The intracellular redox signals generated by these agents are sensed by the SoxR 
      protein which, when activated, functions as a potent activator of soxS 
      transcription. The resulting increased level of SoxS protein then activates 
      approximately 10 genes that constitute the soxRS regulon. Although the SoxS 
      protein is homologous to the COOH-terminal region of the AraC family of 
      regulatory proteins, the mechanism by which SoxS protein activates the soxRS 
      regulon promoters is unknown. We identified in extracts of cells expressing high 
      levels of SoxS protein a DNA binding activity specific for fragments containing 
      soxRS-regulated promoters. This binding activity was purified to physical 
      homogeneity and proved to be the SoxS protein, as confirmed by NH2-terminal amino 
      acid sequencing. The purified SoxS protein bound specifically to the promoters of 
      the micF, zwf, nfo, and sodA genes. Multiple DNA-protein complexes were formed by 
      SoxS in a concentration-dependent fashion with each of these promoters. This 
      binding of SoxS protein also facilitated the subsequent binding of E. coli RNA 
      polymerase to both the micF and the nfo promoters. The binding sites of SoxS in 
      the zwf and micF promoters were identified by DNase I footprinting, which 
      revealed an extended protected region immediately upstream of the respective -35 
      sites. These results indicate that the small SoxS protein (M(r) of only 12,900) 
      is a direct transcriptional activator of the oxidative stress genes of the soxRS 
      regulon, although the possible involvement of other proteins in transcription 
      activation by SoxS has not been ruled out.

TI  - Activation by nitric oxide of an oxidative-stress response that defends 
      Escherichia coli against activated macrophages.
PG  - 9993-7
AB  - Nitric oxide is a free radical (NO) formed biologically through the oxidation of 
      L-arginine by nitric oxide synthases. NO is produced transiently in mammalian 
      cells for intercellular signaling and in copious quantities to cause cytostasis 
      and cytotoxicity. In the latter situation, NO is a deliberate cytotoxic product 
      of activated macrophages, along with other reactive oxygen species such as 
      hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2-). Escherichia coli has a complex set 
      of responses to H2O2 and O2- that involves approximately 80 inducible proteins; 
      we wondered whether these bacteria might induce analogous defenses against nitric 
      oxide. We show here that a multigene system controlled by the redox-sensitive 
      transcriptional regulator SoxR is activated by NO in vivo. This induction confers 
      bacterial resistance to activated murine macrophages with kinetics that parallel 
      the production of NO by these cells. Elimination of specific SoxR-regulated genes 
      diminishes the resistance of these bacteria to the cytotoxic macrophages. The 
      required functions include manganese-containing superoxide dismutase, 
      endonuclease IV (a DNA-repair enzyme for oxidative damage), and micF, an 
      antisense regulator of the outer membrane porin OmpF. These results demonstrate 
      that SoxR is a sensor for cellular exposure to NO, and that the soxRS response 
      system may contribute to bacterial virulence.

      of the micF gene in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 877-84
AB  - The product of the micF gene is an endogenous antisense RNA which down-regulates 
      the expression of a major outer membrane protein, OmpF, in E. coli. We report 
      here that two DNA-binding factors compete for the same site in the promoter 
      region of the micF gene: RSBF, a high-affinity redox-sensitive DNA-binding factor 
      that responds to an active oxygen species other than hydrogen peroxide or 
      superoxide anions; and HRBF a heat-resistant DNA-binding factor. Both RSBF and 
      HRBF bind to the same DNA sequence, 5'-TTAAAATCAATAACTTATTCTTAA3-', located 
      upstream of the transcription start site of the micF gene. We present evidence 
      that RSBF could be the controlling factor of a novel regulon involved in the 
      response to oxidative stress in E. coli.

TI  - Posttranscriptional repression of Escherichia coli OmpF protein in response to 
      redox stress: positive control of the micF antisense RNA by the soxRS locus.
PG  - 1026-31
AB  - The soxRS regulon is a cornerstone of the adaptive defense systems of Escherichia 
      coli against oxidative stress. Unexpectedly, activation of this regulon also 
      enhances bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics that seem unrelated to 
      oxygen radicals. We previously correlated this multiple antibiotic resistance 
      with a reduced rate of synthesis of the OmpF outer membrane porin that does not 
      affect the OmpC or OmpA porins. Studies presented here, with operon and gene 
      fusions of ompF to lacZ, show that the soxRS-dependent repression of OmpF is 
      achieved posttranscriptionally. We also show posttranscriptional repression of 
      OmpF mediated by the soxQ1 mutation, which maps to the marA locus. These 
      repressions are dependent on the micF gene, which encodes a small RNA partially 
      complementary to the 5' end of the ompF message. Northern (RNA) blotting 
      experiments show that micF transcription is strongly inducible by the 
      superoxide-generating agent paraquat in a manner that depends completely on the 
      soxRS locus. The soxR-constitutive and soxQ1 mutations elevate the expression of 
      micF in the absence of redox stress. However, the antibiotic resistance mediated 
      by a soxR-constitutive mutation was only partially reversed upon deletion of 
      micF. The soxRS regulon therefore includes other components that contribute to 
      general antibiotic resistance, although the relation of this phenotype to 
      oxidative stress remains to be established.

TI  - Mechanisms of resistance to quinolones.
PG  - 15-23
AB  - Mechanisms of resistance to the quinolones have been described for several 
      bacterial species, but mainly for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Two 
      principal mechanisms have been described: 1) alteration of the DNA gyrase, which 
      is the target site of the quinolones; and 2) diminished accumulation in the cell 
      as a result of either decreased uptake or increased efflux. Alteration of DNA 
      gyrase is usually the result of a mutation in the gyrA, or more rarely, the gyrB 
      gene. All substitutions in subunit A of the gyrase are located in the 67 to 106 
      amino-acid domain and are clustered around Ser-83 in E. coli and Ser-84 in S. 
      aureus. A decrease in uptake has been described for Gram-negative bacteria such 
      as Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It has almost always been 
      correlated with a modified electrophoretic profile of outer membrane proteins of 
      the quinolone-resistant mutants. In E. coli, a decrease in OmpF seemed to be 
      linked to the activation of the micF operon in most of the mutants described. 
      These mutants were cross-resistant to unrelated antibiotics, such as 
      trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and some beta-lactams. In all these 
      mutants the normal or enhanced efflux of quinolones increased the level of 
      resistance. Enhanced efflux has been described as the second mechanism of 
      resistance in S. aureus. Acquired resistance to the quinolones was thought, until 
      recently, to result from chromosomal mutation. Plasmid-mediated resistance 
      associated with an enhanced efflux has been described in S. aureus, but this 
      needs to be confirmed. When a high level of resistance is observed, 2 or 3 
      mechanisms may be involved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Quinolone resistance mutations (cfxB1, marA1, and soxQ1) that reduce porin outer 
      membrane protein OmpF map near 34 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome. Another 
      such mutation, nfxC1, was found in strain KF131 (nfxB, 19 min). nfxC1 and cfxB1 
      mutants (selected with quinolones) differed slightly but reproducibly from marA1 
      (selected with tetracycline) and soxQ1 (selected with menadione) mutants in 
      quinolone resistance and linkage to zdd2208::Tn10kan (33.7 min). For nfxB nfxC1 
      and cfxB1 mutants, as previously shown for marA mutants, resistance and reduced 
      OmpF required the micF locus encoding an antisense RNA complementary to ompF mRNA 
      and were associated with increased micF expression.

TI  - Expression of micF involved in porin synthesis in Escherichia coli: two distinct 
      cis-acting elements respectively regulate micF expression positively and 
      negatively.
PG  - 39-44
AB  - micF RNA, whose sequence is highly complementary to a 5'-portion of ompF mRNA, 
      has been implicated in the osmoregulation and thermoregulation of the ompF porin 
      gene in Escherichia coli. To define and characterize cis-acting regulatory 
      regions upstream of the micF promoter, a series of deletions of the micF promoter 
      fused to the lacZ gene were constructed. Two distinct regions, which function 
      differently, were identified as cis-acting regulatory elements, namely, one 
      responsible for OmpR-dependent activation and the other for OmpR-independent 
      repression of micF expression. The former contains the OmpR-binding site, which 
      simultaneously regulates both the genes, micF and ompC, in response to the medium 
      osmolarity. The latter may be involved in an unknown regulatory process of micF 
      expression.

TI  - Regulation of ompF porin expression by salicylate in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5631-8
AB  - The expression of ompF, the gene encoding a major outer membrane protein of 
      Escherichia coli, is regulated by various environmental factors. The mechanism by 
      which salicylate (SAL) drastically reduces ompF expression was studied here by 
      means of lacZ fusions to ompF, ompC, and micF, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel 
      electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins, and by measurements of outer membrane 
      permeability. Growth of E. coli in LB broth containing SAL strongly reduced 
      ompF-specific translation of an ompF-lacZ fusion. The extent of this reduction 
      varied with the SAL concentration from 64% at 0.5 mM to 95% at 2 mM and greater 
      than 99% at 10 mM. ompF-lacZ transcription was not affected by SAL, whereas 
      ompC-lacZ transcription was elevated by 70%. Since the micF transcript is 
      antisense to a portion of the ompF transcript and is capable of decreasing the 
      translation of ompF, the effect of SAL on micF transcription was measured in a 
      micF-lacZ fusion strain. SAL-grown cells contained three- to fourfold more micF 
      transcript during the logarithmic phase of growth than did the control cultures. 
      However, micF was not absolutely required for the response to SAL. In 
      micF-deleted strains, the effects of SAL on ompF translation, on OmpF in the 
      outer membrane, and on outer membrane permeability were diminished but still 
      evident. The effect of SAL on ompF expression was independent of the osmolarity 
      of the medium and was epistatic to certain ompB regulatory mutations: the high 
      levels of ompF expression found in envZ3 and ompR472 strains were greatly reduced 
      by growth in SAL. Unexpectedly, the OmpC- phenotypes of these mutants were 
      suppressed by SAL. Thus, growth in SAL severely decreases the translation of ompF 
      while enhancing the transcription of micF and ompC. In this respect, SAL-grown 
      cells resemble certain marA and tolC mutants that have high levels of micF and 
      ompC transcripts and low levels of OmpF.

TI  - micF RNA binds to the 5' end of ompF mRNA and to a protein from Escherichia coli.
PG  - 9249-56
AB  - micF RNA regulates the levels of outer membrane protein F (OmpF) in Escherichia 
      coli in response to temperature increase and other stress conditions by 
      decreasing the levels of ompF mRNA (Andersen et al., 1989). A 93-nucleotide micF 
      RNA was synthesized in vitro directly from polymerase chain reaction generated 
      DNA which was designed to contain a functional T7 RNA polymerase promoter 
      upstream of the micF RNA gene and an appropriate restriction site for 
      transcription termination. A transcript (150 nucleotides) containing the 
      ribosomal binding domain of ompF mRNA messenger was synthesized in vitro from the 
      ompF gene cloned into a T7 expression vector. A stable duplex was formed between 
      micF RNA and the 150-nucleotide 5' transcript of ompF mRNA after incubation at 37 
      degrees C in a physiological buffer. The melting curve of the duplex formed by 
      micF RNA and 150-nucleotide transcript revealed a Tm of 56 degrees C and a delta 
      Tm that spans about 20 degrees C; both are consistent with the proposed structure 
      for the micF/ompF duplex. In addition, as determined by competition studies and 
      UV cross-linking/label-transfer analyses, an E. coli protein was found to bind 
      specifically to micF RNA. The protein also bound weakly to the 150-nucleotide 
      ompF transcript. The data are the first to demonstrate the complex between micF 
      RNA and the 5' end of ompF mRNA and suggest that in vivo a micF ribonucleoprotein 
      (RNP) particle may participate in the destabilization ompF mRNA during 
      thermoregulation of OmpF porin.

TI  - micF RNA in ompB mutants of Escherichia coli: different pathways regulate micF 
      RNA levels in response to osmolarity and temperature change.
PG  - 4143-50
AB  - The repressor RNA, micF RNA, is regulated by temperature, osmolarity, and other 
      stress conditions during growth of Escherichia coli. Northern (RNA) blot analyses 
      showed that levels of micF RNA differ widely in various ompB mutant strains when 
      cells are grown at 24 degrees C in LB broth. For example, relative to the 
      parental strain MC4100, the ompR101 mutant strain (which contains no functional 
      OmpR) had about a 10-fold reduction in micF RNA, whereas the envZ11 strain showed 
      about a 5-fold increase. At 37 degrees C, however, micF RNA levels in the ompR101 
      and envZ11 strains and other ompB mutants differed by less than two-fold compared 
      with the level in strain MC4100, thus indicating that a factor(s) independent of 
      the ompB locus regulates micF RNA expression with temperature increase and that 
      there is an additional control mechanism(s) which maintains the levels of micF 
      RNA in these mutants close to that of the wild type during growth at high 
      temperatures. In a plasmid strain containing the micF gene but without the 
      upstream OmpR-binding site, steady-state levels of micF RNA increased with 
      temperature increase but did not change with osmolarity increase. This showed 
      that osmolal regulation but not temperature regulation of micF depends on these 
      upstream sequences and suggested that while osmolal regulation of the micF gene 
      depends on OmpR, thermal regulation does not.

TI  - Molecular characterization of an Enterobacter cloacae gene (romA) which 
      pleiotropically inhibits the expression of Escherichia coli outer membrane 
      proteins.
PG  - 4082-9
AB  - The introduction of a newly cloned Enterobacter cloacae chromosomal gene romA, 
      into Escherichia coli and E. cloacae resulted in enhancement of resistance to 
      quinolones, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. The primary effect 
      of romA on a multicopy vector in E. coli was almost complete inhibition of OmpF 
      expression in the outer membrane. From the experiments with ompR and envZ mutants 
      or with ompF-lacZ and ompC-lacZ fusion plasmids, it was concluded that this 
      inhibition is posttranscriptional. The introduction of romA on a multicopy vector 
      into strains with micF deletion elicited only a moderate decrease in OmpF protein 
      expression. This indicates that reduction of OmpF expression by romA is partly 
      mediated posttranscriptionally by the activation of micF. Moreover, the 
      overexpression of RomA protein from an isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside 
      (IPTG)-inducible promoter resulted in nearly complete inhibition of expression of 
      OmpC and OmpA, as well as OmpF. Taken together with an observation in a recent 
      study that overexpressed OmpC inhibited the synthesis of OmpA and LamB, a 
      possible inhibitory mechanism at the translational stage of the synthesis of 
      outer membrane proteins should also be considered. By Southern hybridization, 
      romA was generally detected in the chromosomes of all E. cloacae strains tested 
      but not in the E. coli K-12 chromosome. Sequence data show that there is an open 
      reading frame specifying 368 amino acids residues including a putative signal 
      peptide. RomA appears to belong to the outer membrane protein family since it was 
      extractable from an outer membrane preparation, but no sequence homology to other 
      outer membrane proteins was detected.

      presence of ethanol. After a switch to higher growth temperature, the levels of 
      ompF mRNA and of newly synthesized OmpF decrease with time in E. coli strain, 
      MC4100 but these decreases are not observed in isogenic micF deletion strain, 
      SM3001. In addition, while levels of ompF mRNA are substantially reduced in both 
      strains in response to high osmolarity or ethanol at 24 degrees C, the reduced 
      levels in the parental strain are still 4-5-fold lower compared with the micF 
      deletion strain. These findings indicate that chromosomally derived micF RNA 
      plays a major role in the thermal regulation of OmpF and represses OmpF synthesis 
      in response to several environmental signals by decreasing the levels of ompF 
      mRNA. Analyses of the effect of a multicopy micF plasmid on the levels of OmpF 
      and ompF mRNA after an increase in temperature indicated that multicopies of micF 
      RNA markedly inhibited OmpF synthesis but did not accentuate ompF mRNA decrease. 
      These data suggest that multicopy micF inhibits OmpF synthesis primarily through 
      translational inactivation of ompF mRNA and that a limiting factor in addition to 
      micF RNA is necessary to destabilize ompF mRNA.

TI  - marA locus causes decreased expression of OmpF porin in 
      multiple-antibiotic-resistant (Mar) mutants of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5416-22
AB  - Mar (multiple antibiotic resistant) mutants of Escherichia coli express 
      chromosomally mediated resistance to a variety of structurally unrelated 
      hydrophilic and hydrophobic antibiotics. Insertion of transposon Tn5 into the 
      marA locus at min 34.05 on the chromosome completely reverses the Mar phenotype 
      (A. M. George and S. B. Levy, J. Bacteriol. 155:531-540, 1983). We found that 
      among changes in the outer membrane of Mar mutants, porin OmpF was greatly 
      reduced, although Mar mutants were more resistant than cells lacking only OmpF. 
      Transduction of the marA region from a Mar strain, but not a wild-type strain, 
      led to loss of OmpF. P1 transduction of marA::Tn5 into a Mar mutant partially 
      restored OmpF levels. Therefore, OmpF reduction required a mutation in the marA 
      region. Mar mutants of an ompF-lacZ operon fusion strain expressed 50 to 75% of 
      the beta-galactosidase activity of the isogenic non-Mar parental strain, while 
      Mar mutants of a protein fusion strain expressed less than 10% of the enzyme 
      activity in the non-Mar strain. These changes were completely reversed by 
      insertion of marA::Tn5. The responsiveness of OmpF-LacZ to osmolarity and 
      temperature changes was similar in Mar and wild-type strains. Although some 
      transcriptional control may have been present, OmpF reduction appeared to occur 
      primarily by a posttranscriptional mechanism. The steady-state levels of ompF 
      mRNA were twofold lower and the mRNA was five times less stable in the Mar mutant 
      than in the wild-type strain. Expression of micF, which lowers ompF mRNA levels, 
      was elevated in Mar strains, as revealed by a micF-lacZ fusion. Studies with 
      strains deleted for the micF locus showed that the marA-dependent reduction of 
      OmpF required an intact micF locus. Our findings suggest that the marA locus 
      directly or indirectly increases micF expression, causing a posttranscriptional 
      decrease in ompF mRNA and reduced amounts of OmpF.

TI  - Role of micF in the tolC-mediated regulation of OmpF, a major outer membrane 
      protein of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 4722-30
AB  - Mutation in the tolC locus greatly reduces normal synthesis of OmpF, a major 
      porin protein of Escherichia coli K-12. Experiments that use ompF-ompC chimeric 
      genes demonstrate that a tolC mutation exerts its effect at either the promoter 
      or the amino-terminal end of the ompF gene. Direct analysis of ompF mRNA from 
      tolC+ and tolC strains showed that the amount of ompF transcript in the latter 
      was greatly reduced. We have also observed that, in addition to reducing the 
      amount of OmpF, a tolC mutation increases the level of OmpC protein to a much 
      greater extent than occurs in an OmpF mutant and also increases micF RNA 
      synthesis as shown by increased beta-galactosidase synthesis in a micF-lacZ 
      fusion strain. Based on these observations, we suggest that an increased 
      expression of the micF gene in a tolC mutant results in the reduced expression of 
      ompF and that a major effect of the tolC mutation may be to push the 
      porin-regulating system to favor ompC and micF to a greater extent than under 
      high-osmolarity conditions.

TI  - Function of micF as an antisense RNA in osmoregulatory expression of the ompF 
      gene in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 3007-12
AB  - To analyze the function of micF as an antisera RNA in the osmoregulatory 
      expression of the ompF gene in Escherichia coli, we performed two experiments. In 
      the first experiment, two strains were constructed in which the transcription 
      initiation site of the ompF gene and the transcription termination site of the 
      micF gene were separated by 186 and 4,100 base pairs, respectively, on the 
      chromosome. These two strains showed almost the same profile of ompF expression 
      as the wild-type strain in which the two genes are separated by 10(6) base pairs. 
      When a high-copy-number plasmid carrying the micF gene was introduced into these 
      strains, ompF expression was completely repressed, whereas no repression was 
      observed with a low-copy-number plasmid carrying the micF gene. These results 
      indicate that the distance between the two genes on the chromosome is not 
      critical for the function of micF. In the second experiment, expression of the 
      ompF gene was examined by pulse-labeling in both the micF+ and the micF deletion 
      strains. Upon a shift from a low- to a high-osmolarity medium, suppression of 
      OmpF protein synthesis occurred more quickly and more extensively in the micF+ 
      strain than in the micF deletion strain. The steady-state synthesis of the OmpF 
      protein was also completely suppressed in the micF+ strain in the high-osmolarity 
      medium, whereas the suppression was incomplete in the micF deletion strain. From 
      these results we conclude that (i) the micF gene contributes to the fast and 
      complete response of the OmpF synthesis to the medium osmolarity, and that (ii) 
      the distance between the micF and ompF genes on the chromosomes is not critical 
      for the function of the micF gene. The results suggest, rather, that the ratio of 
      the copy numbers of the two genes is critical for the function of the micF gene.

TI  - The isolation and characterization of RNA coded by the micF gene in Escherichia 
      coli.
PG  - 2089-101
AB  - A new species of micF RNA, which contains 93 nucleotides (a 4.5S size), was 
      isolated from Escherichia coli. The sequence of the 4.5S micF RNA corresponds to 
      positions G82 through U174 of the micF gene. The 5' terminal end of this smaller 
      micF RNA is triphosphorylated signifying that it is a primary transcript. Its 
      promoter region, which is situated within the greater micF structural gene, has 
      been identified and characterized by lacZ fusion analysis. A 6S micF RNA species, 
      which has a base composition predicted for a transcript from the full length gene 
      has also been detected; however, the 4.5S micF RNA is the predominant species. 
      The work clearly shows by biochemical identification the presence of 
      chromosomally encoded micF RNA.

TI  - Construction and characterization of a deletion mutant lacking micF, a proposed 
      regulatory gene for OmpF synthesis in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1196-202
AB  - A method is presented for the construction of a deletion mutant lacking the micF 
      gene, which has been proposed to negatively regulate expression of the ompF gene. 
      The method includes (i) construction of a temperature-sensitive plasmid 
      containing a chromosomal fragment that carries both flanking regions of the micF 
      gene but does not carry micF itself and (ii) replacement of the corresponding 
      chromosomal domain with the fragment. The method is applicable to construction of 
      a deletion mutant for any Escherichia coli chromosomal gene provided that it is 
      dispensable. The micF deletion was confirmed by genetic and biochemical tests, 
      including nucleotide sequence analysis. ompF expression in the micF deletion 
      mutant thus constructed was normally regulated and was not enhanced. When micF 
      was cloned into a high-copy-number plasmid it repressed ompF gene expression, 
      whereas when cloned into a low-copy-number plasmid it did not. From these 
      results, it is concluded that a single copy of the micF gene on the E. coli 
      chromosome does not play a critical role in ompF gene expression.

PG  - 337-42
AB  - The previously described Stc- (suppressor of TolC) mutation modifies the 
      phenotype of tolC mutants from OmpF- to OmpF+. Restriction mapping of chromosomal 
      DNA from Stc+ and Stc- strains was performed to investigate the nature of the 
      mutation which was shown to be a deletion, upstream of the ompC gene. DNA from 
      the region of the deletion was cloned into pUC18 and a 650-bp PstI-EcoRI fragment 
      was sequenced. The deletion started 49 bp upstream of the AUG start codon of the 
      ompC gene, thus removing part of the ompC promoter and the whole of the micF 
      gene. We suggest that the deletion of micF gives rise to the Stc- phenotype since 
      the effect of micF expression is assumed to reduce ompF expression, and the Stc- 
      phenotype involves increase in ompF expression.

      complementary RNA transcript (micRNA).

AB  - The expression of the genes for the major outer membrane proteins OmpF and OmpC 
      are osmoregulated. The ompC locus was found to be transcribed bidirectionally 
      under conditions of high osmolarity and a 174-base transcript encoded upstream of 
      ompC was found to inhibit the OmpF production and to substantially reduce the 
      amount of the ompF mRNA. This RNA [mRNA-interfering complementary RNA (micRNA)] 
      has a long sequence that is complementary to the 5' end region of the ompF mRNA. 
      We propose that the micRNA inhibits the translation of the ompF mRNA by 
      hybridizing with it. This RNA interaction may cause premature termination of the 
      transcription of the ompF gene or destabilization of the ompF mRNA or both.
