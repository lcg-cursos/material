TI  - Regulation of phosphate starvation-specific responses in Escherichia coli.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001312 [doi]
LID - 001312
AB  - Toxic agents added into the medium of rapidly growing Escherichia coli induce 
      specific stress responses through the activation of specialized transcription 
      factors. Each transcription factor and downstream regulon (e.g. SoxR) are linked 
      to a unique stress (e.g. superoxide stress). Cells starved of phosphate induce 
      several specific stress regulons during the transition to stationary phase when 
      the growth rate is steadily declining. Whereas the regulatory cascades leading to 
      the expression of specific stress regulons are well known in rapidly growing 
      cells stressed by toxic products, they are poorly understood in cells starved of 
      phosphate. The intent of this review is to both describe the unique mechanisms of 
      activation of specialized transcription factors and discuss signalling cascades 
      leading to the induction of specific stress regulons in phosphate-starved cells. 
      Finally, I discuss unique defence mechanisms that could be induced in cells 
      starved of ammonium and glucose.

AB  - In response to DNA damage, bacterial RecA protein forms filaments with the 
      assistance of DinI protein. The RecA filaments stimulate the autocleavage of 
      LexA, the repressor of more than 50 SOS genes, and activate the SOS response. 
      During the late phase of SOS response, the RecA filaments stimulate the 
      autocleavage of UmuD and λ repressor CI, leading to mutagenic repair and lytic 
      cycle, respectively. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structures 
      of Escherichia coli RecA filaments in complex with DinI, LexA, UmuD, and λCI by 
      helical reconstruction. The structures reveal that LexA and UmuD dimers bind in 
      the filament groove and cleave in an intramolecular and an intermolecular manner, 
      respectively, while λCI binds deeply in the filament groove as a monomer. Despite 
      their distinct folds and oligomeric states, all RecA filament binders recognize 
      the same conserved protein features in the filament groove. The SOS response in 
      bacteria can lead to mutagenesis and antimicrobial resistance, and our study 
      paves the way for rational drug design targeting the bacterial SOS response.

TI  - Identification of genetic interactions with priB links the PriA/PriB DNA 
      replication restart pathway to double-strand DNA break repair in Escherichia 
      coli.
LID - 10.1093/g3journal/jkac295 [doi]
LID - jkac295
AB  - Collisions between DNA replication complexes (replisomes) and impediments such as 
      damaged DNA or proteins tightly bound to the chromosome lead to premature 
      dissociation of replisomes at least once per cell cycle in Escherichia coli. Left 
      unrepaired, these events produce incompletely replicated chromosomes that cannot 
      be properly partitioned into daughter cells. DNA replication restart, the process 
      that reloads replisomes at prematurely terminated sites, is therefore essential 
      in E. coli and other bacteria. Three replication restart pathways have been 
      identified in E. coli: PriA/PriB, PriA/PriC, and PriC/Rep. A limited number of 
      genetic interactions between replication restart and other genome maintenance 
      pathways have been defined, but a systematic study placing replication restart 
      reactions in a broader cellular context has not been performed. We have utilized 
      transposon-insertion sequencing to identify new genetic interactions between DNA 
      replication restart pathways and other cellular systems. Known genetic 
      interactors with the priB replication restart gene (uniquely involved in the 
      PriA/PriB pathway) were confirmed and several novel priB interactions were 
      discovered. Targeted genetic and imaging-based experiments with priB and its 
      genetic partners revealed significant double-strand DNA break accumulation in 
      strains with mutations in dam, rep, rdgC, lexA, or polA. Modulating the activity 
      of the RecA recombinase partially suppressed the detrimental effects of rdgC or 
      lexA mutations in ΔpriB cells. Taken together, our results highlight roles for 
      several genes in double-strand DNA break homeostasis and define a genetic network 
      that facilitates DNA repair/processing upstream of PriA/PriB-mediated DNA 
      replication restart in E. coli.

TI  - Regulation of ssb Gene Expression in Escherichia coli.
LID - 10.3390/ijms231810917 [doi]
LID - 10917
AB  - Bacterial SSB proteins, as well as their eukaryotic RPA analogues, are essential 
      and ubiquitous. They avidly bind single-stranded DNA and regulate/coordinate its 
      metabolism, hence enabling essential DNA processes such as replication, 
      transcription, and repair. The prototypic Escherichia coli SSB protein is encoded 
      by an ssb gene. Although the ssb gene promoters harbor an SOS box, multiple 
      studies over several decades failed to elucidate whether ssb gene expression is 
      inducible and SOS dependent. The SOS regulon is comprised of about 50 genes, 
      whose transcription is coordinately induced under stress conditions. Using 
      quantitative real-time PCR, we determined the ssb gene expression kinetics in UV- 
      and γ-irradiated E. coli and revealed that ssb gene expression is elevated in 
      irradiated cells in an SOS-dependent manner. Additionally, the expression of the 
      sulA gene was determined to indicate the extent of SOS induction. In a mutant 
      with a constitutively induced SOS regulon, the ssb gene was overexpressed in the 
      absence of DNA damage. Furthermore, we measured ssb gene expression by droplet 
      digital PCR during unaffected bacterial growth and revealed that ssb gene 
      expression was equal in wild-type and SOS(-) bacteria, whereas sulA expression 
      was higher in the former. This study thus reveals a complex pattern of ssb gene 
      expression, which under stress conditions depends on the SOS regulon, whereas 
      during normal bacterial growth it is unlinked to SOS induction. The E. coli ssb 
      gene is SOS regulated in such a way that its basal expression is relatively high 
      and can be increased only through stronger SOS induction. The remarkable SOS 
      induction observed in undisturbed wild-type cells may challenge our notion of the 
      physiological role of the SOS response in bacteria.

TI  - Transcriptomic Analysis of E. coli after Exposure to a Sublethal Concentration of 
      Hydrogen Peroxide Revealed a Coordinated Up-Regulation of the Cysteine 
      Biosynthesis Pathway.
LID - 10.3390/antiox11040655 [doi]
LID - 655
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is a key defense component of host-microbe 
      interaction. However, H(2)O(2) concentrations generated by immune cells or 
      epithelia are usually insufficient for bacterial killing and rather modulate 
      bacterial responses. Here, we investigated the impact of sublethal H(2)O(2) 
      concentration on gene expression of E. coli BW25113 after 10 and 60 min of 
      exposure. RNA-seq analysis revealed that approximately 12% of bacterial genes 
      were strongly dysregulated 10 min following exposure to 2.5 mM H(2)O(2). H(2)O(2) 
      exposure led to the activation of a specific antioxidant response and a general 
      stress response. The latter was characterized by a transient down-regulation of 
      genes involved in general metabolism, such as nucleic acid biosynthesis and 
      translation, with a striking and coordinated down-regulation of genes involved in 
      ribosome formation, and a sustained up-regulation of the SOS response. We 
      confirmed the rapid transient and specific response mediated by the transcription 
      factor OxyR leading to up-regulation of antioxidant systems, including the 
      catalase-encoding gene (katG), that rapidly degrade extracellular H(2)O(2) and 
      promote bacterial survival. We documented a strong and transient up-regulation of 
      genes involved in sulfur metabolism and cysteine biosynthesis, which are under 
      the control of the transcription factor CysB. This strong specific 
      transcriptional response to H(2)O(2) exposure had no apparent impact on bacterial 
      survival, but possibly replenishes the stores of oxidized cysteine and 
      glutathione. In summary, our results demonstrate that different stress response 
      mechanisms are activated by H(2)O(2) exposure and highlight the cysteine 
      synthesis as an antioxidant response in E. coli.

TI  - Fluoroquinolone Persistence in Escherichia coli Requires DNA Repair despite 
      Differing between Starving Populations.

AB  - When faced with nutritional deprivation, bacteria undergo a range of metabolic, 
      regulatory, and biosynthetic changes. Those adjustments, which can be specific or 
      independent of the missing nutrient, often alter bacterial tolerance to 
      antibiotics. Here, using fluoroquinolones, we quantified Escherichia coli 
      persister levels in cultures experiencing starvation from a lack of carbon (C), 
      nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), or magnesium (Mg(2+)). Interestingly, persister 
      levels varied significantly based on the type of starvation as well as 
      fluoroquinolone used with N-starved populations exhibiting the highest 
      persistence to levofloxacin, and P-starved populations exhibiting the highest 
      persistence to moxifloxacin. However, regardless of the type of starvation or 
      fluoroquinolone used, DNA repair was required by persisters, with ∆recA and ∆recB 
      uniformly exhibiting the lowest persistence of the mutants assayed. These results 
      suggest that while the type of starvation and fluoroquinolone will modulate the 
      level of persistence, the importance of homologous recombination is consistently 
      observed, which provides further support for efforts to target homologous 
      recombination for anti-persister purposes.

TI  - High-Throughput Screening of a Promoter Library Reveals New Persister Mechanisms 
      in Escherichia Coli.

AB  - Persister cells are a small subpopulation of phenotypic variants that survive 
      high concentrations of bactericidal antibiotics. Their survival mechanisms are 
      not heritable and can be formed stochastically or triggered by environmental 
      stresses such as antibiotic treatment. In this study, high-throughput screening 
      of an Escherichia coli promoter library and subsequent validation experiments 
      identified several genes whose expression was upregulated by antibiotic 
      treatment. Among the identified genes, waaG, guaA, and guaB were found to be 
      important in persister cell formation in E. coli as their deletion significantly 
      enhanced the sensitivity of cells to various antibiotics. The GuaA and GuaB 
      enzymes form the upstream reactions of ppGpp (a global persister molecule) 
      biosynthesis, and the deletion of guaA and guaB drastically perturbs the ppGpp 
      regulon in E. coli. WaaG, a lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase, plays an 
      important role in shaping the outer membrane structure, and the deletion of waaG 
      dissipates the proton gradient (ΔpH) component of cellular proton motive force 
      (PMF), perturbs cellular ATP production, and reduces type I persister formation 
      in stationary phase. Active respiration in the stationary phase, which drives the 
      PMF, was previously shown to play a critical role in type I persister formation, 
      and our results associated with the waaG deficient strain further corroborate 
      these findings. IMPORTANCE Persistence is a nonheritable trait by which normal 
      growing cells switch phenotypically to antibiotic tolerant persister cells. This 
      transient state enables persister cells to recover and grow into an 
      antibiotic-sensitive population. Persister cells have been observed in many 
      pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria. Previous studies highlight the complexity 
      and diversity of bacterial persister-cell mechanisms, many of which still remain 
      to be elucidated. Here, using promoter and knockout cell libraries in Escherichia 
      coli, we have identified genes that reveal novel persister mechanisms. As 
      persistence is a critical survival strategy that evolved in many bacteria, our 
      study will enhance the current molecular-level understanding of this conserved 
      mechanism.

AB  - Organisms orchestrate cellular functions through transcription factor (TF) 
      interactions with their target genes, although these regulatory relationships are 
      largely unknown in most species. Here we report a high-throughput approach for 
      characterizing TF-target gene interactions across species and its application to 
      354 TFs across 48 bacteria, generating 17,000 genome-wide binding maps. This 
      dataset revealed themes of ancient conservation and rapid evolution of regulatory 
      modules. We observed rewiring, where the TF sensing and regulatory role is 
      maintained while the arrangement and identity of target genes diverges, in some 
      cases encoding entirely new functions. We further integrated phenotypic 
      information to define new functional regulatory modules and pathways. Finally, we 
      identified 242 new TF DNA binding motifs, including a 70% increase of known 
      Escherichia coli motifs and the first annotation in Pseudomonas simiae, revealing 
      deep conservation in bacterial promoter architecture. Our method provides a 
      versatile tool for functional characterization of genetic pathways in prokaryotes 
      and eukaryotes.

TI  - Single-molecule imaging of LexA degradation in Escherichia coli elucidates 
      regulatory mechanisms and heterogeneity of the SOS response.
PG  - 981-990
LID - 10.1038/s41564-021-00930-y [doi]
AB  - The bacterial SOS response represents a paradigm of gene networks controlled by a 
      master transcriptional regulator. Self-cleavage of the SOS repressor LexA induces 
      a wide range of cell functions that are critical for survival and adaptation when 
      bacteria experience stress conditions(1) including DNA repair(2), 
      mutagenesis(3,4), horizontal gene transfer(5-7), filamentous growth and the 
      induction of bacterial toxins(8-12), toxin-antitoxin systems(13), virulence 
      factors(6,14) and prophages(15-17). SOS induction is also implicated in biofilm 
      formation and antibiotic persistence(11,18-20). Considering the fitness burden of 
      these functions, it is surprising that the expression of LexA-regulated genes is 
      highly variable across cells(10,21-23) and that cell subpopulations induce the 
      SOS response spontaneously even in the absence of stress 
      exposure(9,11,12,16,24,25). Whether this reflects a population survival strategy 
      or a regulatory inaccuracy is unclear, as are the mechanisms underlying SOS 
      heterogeneity. Here, we developed a single-molecule imaging approach based on a 
      HaloTag fusion to directly monitor LexA in live Escherichia coli cells, 
      demonstrating the existence of three main states of LexA: DNA-bound stationary 
      molecules, free LexA and degraded LexA species. These analyses elucidate the 
      mechanisms by which DNA binding and degradation of LexA regulate the SOS response 
      in vivo. We show that self-cleavage of LexA occurs frequently throughout the 
      population during unperturbed growth, rather than being restricted to a 
      subpopulation of cells. This causes substantial cell-to-cell variation in LexA 
      abundances. LexA variability underlies SOS gene-expression heterogeneity and 
      triggers spontaneous SOS pulses, which enhance bacterial survival in anticipation 
      of stress.

TI  - Genetic Analysis of DinG Family Helicase YoaA and Its Interaction with 
      Replication Clamp Loader Protein HolC in Escherichia coli.
PG  - e0022821
LID - 10.1128/JB.00228-21 [doi]
LID - e00228-21
AB  - The XP-D/DinG family of DNA helicases contributes to genomic stability in all 
      three domains of life. Here, we investigate the role of one of these proteins, 
      YoaA, of Escherichia coli. In E. coli, YoaA aids in tolerance to the nucleoside 
      azidothymidine (AZT), a DNA replication inhibitor, and physically interacts with 
      a subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, HolC. We map the residues of YoaA 
      required for HolC interaction to its C terminus by yeast two-hybrid analysis. We 
      propose that this interaction competes with HolC's interaction with HolD and the 
      rest of the replisome; YoaA indeed inhibits growth when overexpressed, dependent 
      on this interaction region. By gene fusions, we show that YoaA is repressed by 
      LexA and induced in response to DNA damage as part of the SOS response. Induction 
      of YoaA by AZT is biphasic, with an immediate response after treatment and a 
      slower response that peaks in the late log phase of growth. This 
      growth-phase-dependent induction by AZT is not blocked by lexA3 (Ind(-)), which 
      normally negates its self-cleavage, implying another means to induce the DNA 
      damage response that responds to the nutritional state of the cell. We propose 
      that YoaA helicase activity increases access to the 3' nascent strand during 
      replication; consistent with this, YoaA appears to aid in the removal of 
      potential A-to-T transversion mutations in ndk mutants, which are prone to 
      nucleotide misincorporation. We provide evidence that YoaA and its paralog DinG 
      may also initiate template switching that leads to deletions between tandem 
      repeats in DNA. IMPORTANCE Maintaining genomic stability is crucial for all 
      living organisms. Replication of DNA frequently encounters barriers that must be 
      removed to complete genome duplication. Balancing DNA synthesis with its repair 
      is critical and not entirely understood at a mechanistic level. The YoaA protein, 
      studied here, is required for certain types of DNA repair and interacts in an 
      alternative manner with proteins that catalyze DNA replication. YoaA is part of 
      the well-studied LexA-regulated response to DNA damage, the SOS response. We 
      describe an unusual feature of its regulation that promotes induction after DNA 
      damage as the culture begins to experience starvation. Replication fork repair 
      integrates both DNA damage and nutritional signals. We also show that YoaA 
      affects genomic stability.

LID - e00718-20
AB  - Feedback mechanisms are fundamental to the control of physiological responses. 
      One important example in gene regulation, termed negative autoregulation (NAR), 
      occurs when a transcription factor (TF) inhibits its own production through 
      transcriptional repression. This enables more-rapid homeostatic control of gene 
      expression. NAR circuits presumably evolve to limit the fitness costs of 
      gratuitous gene expression. The key biochemical reactions of NAR can be 
      parameterized using a mathematical model of promoter activity; however, this 
      model of NAR has been studied mostly in the context of synthetic NAR circuits 
      that are disconnected from the target genes of the TFs. Thus, it remains unclear 
      how constrained NAR parameters are in a native circuit context, where the TF 
      target genes can have fitness effects on the cell. To quantify these constraints, 
      we created a panel of Escherichia coli strains with different lexA-NAR circuit 
      parameters and analyzed the effect on SOS response function and bacterial 
      fitness. Using a mathematical model for NAR, these experimental data were used to 
      calculate NAR parameter values and derive a parameter-fitness landscape. Without 
      feedback, survival of DNA damage was decreased due to high LexA concentrations 
      and slower SOS "turn-on" kinetics. However, we show that, even in the absence of 
      DNA damage, the lexA promoter is strong enough that, without feedback, high 
      levels of lexA expression result in a fitness cost to the cell. Conversely, 
      hyperfeedback can mimic lexA deletion, which is also costly. This work elucidates 
      the lexA-NAR parameter values capable of balancing the cell's requirement for 
      rapid SOS response activation with limiting its toxicity.IMPORTANCE Feedback 
      mechanisms are critical to control physiological responses. In gene regulation, 
      one important example, termed negative autoregulation (NAR), occurs when a 
      transcription factor (TF) inhibits its own production. NAR is common across the 
      tree of life, enabling rapid homeostatic control of gene expression. NAR behavior 
      can be described in accordance with its core biochemical parameters, but how 
      constrained these parameters are by evolution is unclear. Here, we describe a 
      model genetic network controlled by an NAR circuit within the bacterium 
      Escherichia coli and elucidate these constraints by experimentally changing a key 
      parameter and measuring its effect on circuit response and fitness. This analysis 
      yielded a parameter-fitness landscape representing the genetic network, providing 
      a window into what gene-environment conditions favor evolution of this regulatory 
      strategy.

TI  - Two components of DNA replication-dependent LexA cleavage.
PG  - 10368-10379
LID - 10.1074/jbc.RA120.014224 [doi]
AB  - Induction of the SOS response, a cellular system triggered by DNA damage in 
      bacteria, depends on DNA replication for the generation of the SOS signal, ssDNA. 
      RecA binds to ssDNA, forming filaments that stimulate proteolytic cleavage of the 
      LexA transcriptional repressor, allowing expression of > 40 gene products 
      involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Here, using a DNA replication 
      system reconstituted in vitro in tandem with a LexA cleavage assay, we studied 
      LexA cleavage during DNA replication of both undamaged and base-damaged 
      templates. Only a ssDNA-RecA filament supported LexA cleavage. Surprisingly, 
      replication of an undamaged template supported levels of LexA cleavage like that 
      induced by a template carrying two site-specific cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. 
      We found that two processes generate ssDNA that could support LexA cleavage. 1) 
      During unperturbed replication, single-stranded regions formed because of 
      stochastic uncoupling of the leading-strand DNA polymerase from the replication 
      fork DNA helicase, and 2) on the damaged template, nascent leading-strand gaps 
      were generated by replisome lesion skipping. The two pathways differed in that 
      RecF stimulated LexA cleavage during replication of the damaged template, but not 
      normal replication. RecF appears to facilitate RecA filament formation on the 
      leading-strand ssDNA gaps generated by replisome lesion skipping.

TI  - The Kinetic and Molecular Basis for the Interaction of LexA and Activated RecA 
      Revealed by a Fluorescent Amino Acid Probe.
PG  - 1127-1133
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.9b00886 [doi]
AB  - The bacterial DNA damage response (the SOS response) is a key pathway involved in 
      antibiotic evasion and a promising target for combating acquired antibiotic 
      resistance. Activation of the SOS response is controlled by two proteins: the 
      repressor LexA and the DNA damage sensor RecA. Following DNA damage, direct 
      interaction between RecA and LexA leads to derepression of the SOS response. 
      However, the exact molecular details of this interaction remain unknown. Here, we 
      employ the fluorescent unnatural amino acid acridonylalanine (Acd) as a minimally 
      perturbing probe of the E. coli RecA:LexA complex. Using LexA labeled with Acd, 
      we report the first kinetic model for the reversible binding of LexA to activated 
      RecA. We also characterize the effects that specific amino acid truncations or 
      substitutions in LexA have on RecA:LexA binding strength and demonstrate that a 
      mobile loop encoding LexA residues 75-84 comprises a key recognition interface 
      for RecA. Beyond insights into SOS activation, our approach also further 
      establishes Acd as a sensitive fluorescent probe for investigating the dynamics 
      of protein-protein interactions in other complex systems.

AB  - Underlying cellular responses is a transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) that 
      modulates gene expression. A useful description of the TRN would decompose the 
      transcriptome into targeted effects of individual transcriptional regulators. 
      Here, we apply unsupervised machine learning to a diverse compendium of over 250 
      high-quality Escherichia coli RNA-seq datasets to identify 92 statistically 
      independent signals that modulate the expression of specific gene sets. We show 
      that 61 of these transcriptomic signals represent the effects of currently 
      characterized transcriptional regulators. Condition-specific activation of 
      signals is validated by exposure of E. coli to new environmental conditions. The 
      resulting decomposition of the transcriptome provides: a mechanistic, 
      systems-level, network-based explanation of responses to environmental and 
      genetic perturbations; a guide to gene and regulator function discovery; and a 
      basis for characterizing transcriptomic differences in multiple strains. Taken 
      together, our results show that signal summation describes the composition of a 
      model prokaryotic transcriptome.

TI  - Inhibition of the transcriptional repressor LexA: Withstanding drug resistance by 
      inhibiting the bacterial mechanisms of adaptation to antimicrobials.

AB  - AIMS: LexA protein is a transcriptional repressor which regulates the expression 
      of more than 60 genes belonging to the SOS global regulatory network activated by 
      damages to bacterial DNA. Considering its role in bacteria, LexA represents a key 
      target to counteract bacterial resistance: the possibility to modulate SOS 
      response through the inhibition of LexA autoproteolysis may lead to reduced drug 
      susceptibility and acquisition of resistance in bacteria. In our study we 
      investigated boron-containing compounds as potential inhibitors of LexA 
      self-cleavage. MAIN METHODS: The inhibition of LexA self-cleavage was evaluated 
      by following the variation of the first-order rate constant by LC-MS at several 
      concentrations of inhibitors. In silico analysis was applied to predict the 
      binding orientations assumed by the inhibitors in the protein active site, upon 
      covalent binding to the catalytic Ser-119. Bacterial filamentation assay was used 
      to confirm the ability of (3-aminophenyl)boronic acid to interfere with SOS 
      induced activation. KEY FINDINGS: Boron-containing compounds act as inhibitors of 
      LexA self-cleavage, as also confirmed by molecular modelling where the compounds 
      interact with the catalytic Ser-119, via the formation of an acyl-enzyme 
      intermediate. A new equation for the description of the inhibition potency in an 
      autoproteolytic enzyme is also disclosed. Bacterial filamentation assays strongly 
      support the interference of our compounds with the SOS response activation 
      through inhibition of septum formation. SIGNIFICANCE: The obtained results 
      demonstrated that phenylboronic compounds could be exploited in a hit-to-lead 
      optimization process toward effective LexA self-cleavage inhibitors. They would 
      sustain the rehabilitation in therapy of several dismissed antibiotics.

TI  - OxyR Is a Convergent Target for Mutations Acquired during Adaptation to Oxidative 
      Stress-Prone Metabolic States.
PG  - 660-667
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msz251 [doi]
AB  - Oxidative stress is concomitant with aerobic metabolism. Thus, bacterial genomes 
      encode elaborate mechanisms to achieve redox homeostasis. Here we report that the 
      peroxide-sensing transcription factor, oxyR, is a common mutational target using 
      bacterial species belonging to two genera, Escherichia coli and Vibrio 
      natriegens, in separate growth conditions implemented during laboratory 
      evolution. The mutations clustered in the redox active site, dimer interface, and 
      flexible redox loop of the protein. These mutations favor the oxidized 
      conformation of OxyR that results in constitutive expression of the genes it 
      regulates. Independent component analysis of the transcriptome revealed that the 
      constitutive activity of OxyR reduces DNA damage from reactive oxygen species, as 
      inferred from the activity of the SOS response regulator LexA. This adaptation to 
      peroxide stress came at a cost of lower growth, as revealed by calculations of 
      proteome allocation using genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular 
      expression. Further, identification of similar sequence changes in natural 
      isolates of E. coli indicates that adaptation to oxidative stress through genetic 
      changes in oxyR can be a common occurrence.

TI  - DnaA and LexA Proteins Regulate Transcription of the uvrB Gene in Escherichia 
      coli: The Role of DnaA in the Control of the SOS Regulon.
PG  - 1212
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.01212 [doi]
LID - 1212
AB  - The uvrB gene belongs to the SOS network, encoding a key component of the 
      nucleotide excision repair. The uvrB promoter region contains three identified 
      promoters with four LexA binding sites, one consensus and six potential DnaA 
      binding sites. A more than threefold increase in transcription of the chromosomal 
      uvrB gene is observed in both the ΔlexA ΔsulA cells and dnaA(A345S) cells, and a 
      fivefold increase in the ΔlexA ΔsulA dnaA(A345S) cells relative to the wild-type 
      cells. The full activity of the uvrB promoter region requires both the uvrBp1-2 
      and uvrBp3 promoters and is repressed by both the DnaA and LexA proteins. LexA 
      binds tightly to LexA-box1 at the uvrBp1-2 promoter irrespective of the presence 
      of DnaA and this binding is important for the control of the uvrBp1-2 promoter. 
      DnaA and LexA, however, compete for binding to and regulation of the uvrBp3 
      promoter in which the DnaA-box6 overlaps with LexA-box4. The transcription 
      control of uvrBp3 largely depends on DnaA-box6. Transcription of other SOS 
      regulon genes, such as recN and dinJ, is also repressed by both DnaA and LexA. 
      Interestingly, the absence of LexA in the presence of the DnaA(A345S) mutant 
      leads to production of elongated cells with incomplete replication, aberrant 
      nucleoids and slow growth. We propose that DnaA is a modulator for maintenance of 
      genome integrity during the SOS response by limiting the expression of the SOS 
      regulon.

TI  - A network of regulators promotes dehydration tolerance in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1283-1295
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.14074 [doi]
AB  - The ability to survive conditions of low water activity is critical for the 
      survival of many bacteria in the environment and facilitates disease transmission 
      through food and contaminated surfaces. However, the molecular mechanisms that 
      enable bacteria to withstand this condition remain poorly understood. Here we 
      describe a network of regulators in Escherichia coli that are important for this 
      bacterium to survive dehydration. We found that the transcriptional regulator 
      DksA and the general stress response regulator RpoS play a critical role. From a 
      plasmid genomic library screen, we identified two additional regulators, Crl and 
      ArcZ, that promote dehydration tolerance through modulation of RpoS. We also 
      found that LexA, RecA and ArcA contribute to survival. Our results identify key 
      regulators that enable E. coli to tolerate dehydration and suggest a hierarchical 
      network is involved in protection against cellular damage associated with this 
      stress.

AB  - Bacteria encounter environmental stresses that regulate a gene expression program 
      required for adaptation and survival. Here, we report the 1.8-Å crystal structure 
      of the Escherichia coli toxin-antitoxin complex YafQ-(DinJ)2-YafQ, a key 
      component of the stress response. The antitoxin DinJ dimer adopts a 
      ribbon-helix-helix motif required for transcriptional autorepression, and toxin 
      YafQ contains a microbial RNase fold whose proposed active site is concealed by 
      DinJ binding. Contrary to previous reports, our studies indicate that equivalent 
      levels of transcriptional repression occur by direct interaction of either 
      YafQ-(DinJ)2-YafQ or a DinJ dimer at a single inverted repeat of its recognition 
      sequence that overlaps with the -10 promoter region. Surprisingly, multiple 
      YafQ-(DinJ)2-YafQ complexes binding to the operator region do not appear to 
      amplify the extent of repression. Our results suggest an alternative model for 
      transcriptional autorepression that may be novel to DinJ-YafQ.

AB  - Recent advances in the area of bacterial DNA damage responses are reviewed here. 
      The SOS pathway is still the major paradigm of bacterial DNA damage response, and 
      recent studies have clarified the mechanisms of SOS induction and key 
      physiological roles of SOS including a very major role in genetic exchange and 
      variation. When considering diverse bacteria, it is clear that SOS is not a 
      uniform pathway with one purpose, but rather a platform that has evolved for 
      differing functions in different bacteria. Relating in part to the SOS response, 
      the field has uncovered multiple apparent cell-cycle checkpoints that assist cell 
      survival after DNA damage and remarkable pathways that induce programmed cell 
      death in bacteria. Bacterial DNA damage responses are also much broader than SOS, 
      and several important examples of LexA-independent regulation will be reviewed. 
      Finally, some recent advances that relate to the replication and repair of 
      damaged DNA will be summarized.

TI  - Integrated stress response of Escherichia coli to methylglyoxal: transcriptional 
      readthrough from the nemRA operon enhances protection through increased 
      expression of glyoxalase I.
PG  - 936-50
LID - 10.1111/mmi.12234 [doi]
AB  - Methylglyoxal (MG) elicits activation of K(+) efflux systems to protect cells 
      against the toxicity of the electrophile. ChIP-chip targeting RNA polymerase, 
      supported by a range of other biochemical measurements and mutant creation, was 
      used to identify genes transcribed in response to MG and which complement this 
      rapid response. The SOS DNA repair regulon is induced at cytotoxic levels of MG, 
      even when exposure to MG is transient. Glyoxalase I alone among the core MG 
      protective systems is induced in response to MG exposure. Increased expression is 
      an indirect consequence of induction of the upstream nemRA operon, encoding an 
      enzyme system that itself does not contribute to MG detoxification. Moreover, 
      this induction, via nemRA only occurs when cells are exposed to growth inhibitory 
      concentrations of MG. We show that the kdpFABCDE genes are induced and that this 
      expression occurs as a result of depletion of cytoplasmic K(+) consequent upon 
      activation of the KefGB K(+) efflux system. Finally, our analysis suggests that 
      the transcriptional changes in response to MG are a culmination of the damage to 
      DNA and proteins, but that some integrate specific functions, such as DNA repair, 
      to augment the allosteric activation of the main protective system, KefGB.

TI  - Single transmembrane peptide DinQ modulates membrane-dependent activities.
PG  - e1003260

LID - e1003260
AB  - The functions of several SOS regulated genes in Escherichia coli are still 
      unknown, including dinQ. In this work we characterize dinQ and two small RNAs, 
      agrA and agrB, with antisense complementarity to dinQ. Northern analysis revealed 
      five dinQ transcripts, but only one transcript (+44) is actively translated. The 
      +44 dinQ transcript translates into a toxic single transmembrane peptide 
      localized in the inner membrane. AgrB regulates dinQ RNA by RNA interference to 
      counteract DinQ toxicity. Thus the dinQ-agr locus shows the classical features of 
      a type I TA system and has many similarities to the tisB-istR locus. DinQ 
      overexpression depolarizes the cell membrane and decreases the intracellular ATP 
      concentration, demonstrating that DinQ can modulate membrane-dependent processes. 
      Augmented DinQ strongly inhibits marker transfer by Hfr conjugation, indicating a 
      role in recombination. Furthermore, DinQ affects transformation of nucleoid 
      morphology in response to UV damage. We hypothesize that DinQ is a transmembrane 
      peptide that modulates membrane-dependent activities such as nucleoid compaction 
      and recombination.

TI  - Interconversion between bound and free conformations of LexA orchestrates the 
      bacterial SOS response.
PG  - 6546-57
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkr265 [doi]
AB  - The bacterial SOS response is essential for the maintenance of genomes, and also 
      modulates antibiotic resistance and controls multidrug tolerance in 
      subpopulations of cells known as persisters. In Escherichia coli, the SOS system 
      is controlled by the interplay of the dimeric LexA transcriptional repressor with 
      an inducer, the active RecA filament, which forms at sites of DNA damage and 
      activates LexA for self-cleavage. Our aim was to understand how RecA filament 
      formation at any chromosomal location can induce the SOS system, which could 
      explain the mechanism for precise timing of induction of SOS genes. Here, we show 
      that stimulated self-cleavage of the LexA repressor is prevented by binding to 
      specific DNA operator targets. Distance measurements using pulse electron 
      paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal that in unbound LexA, the DNA-binding 
      domains sample different conformations. One of these conformations is captured 
      when LexA is bound to operator targets and this precludes interaction by RecA. 
      Hence, the conformational flexibility of unbound LexA is the key element in 
      establishing a co-ordinated SOS response. We show that, while LexA exhibits 
      diverse dissociation rates from operators, it interacts extremely rapidly with 
      DNA target sites. Modulation of LexA activity changes the occurrence of persister 
      cells in bacterial populations.

LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-4-116 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Escherichia coli is one of the best studied model organisms, 
      a comprehensive understanding of its gene regulation is not yet achieved. There 
      exist many approaches to reconstruct regulatory interaction networks from gene 
      expression experiments. Mutual information based approaches are most useful for 
      large-scale network inference. RESULTS: We used a three-step approach in which we 
      combined gene regulatory network inference based on directed information (DTI) 
      and sequence analysis. DTI values were calculated on a set of gene expression 
      profiles from 19 time course experiments extracted from the Many Microbes 
      Microarray Database. Focusing on influences between pairs of genes in which one 
      partner encodes a transcription factor (TF) we derived a network which contains 
      878 TF - gene interactions of which 166 are known according to RegulonDB. 
      Afterward, we selected a subset of 109 interactions that could be confirmed by 
      the presence of a phylogenetically conserved binding site of the respective 
      regulator. By this second step, the fraction of known interactions increased from 
      19% to 60%. In the last step, we checked the 44 of the 109 interactions not yet 
      included in RegulonDB for functional relationships between the regulator and the 
      target and, thus, obtained ten TF - target gene interactions. Five of them 
      concern the regulator LexA and have already been reported in the literature. The 
      remaining five influences describe regulations by Fis (with two novel targets), 
      PhdR, PhoP, and KdgR. For the validation of our approach, one of them, the 
      regulation of lipoate synthase (LipA) by the pyruvate-sensing pyruvate 
      dehydrogenate repressor (PdhR), was experimentally checked and confirmed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We predicted a set of five novel TF - target gene interactions in E. 
      coli. One of them, the regulation of lipA by the transcriptional regulator PdhR 
      was validated experimentally. Furthermore, we developed DTInfer, a new R-package 
      for the inference of gene-regulatory networks from microarrays using directed 
      information.

TI  - Structure of the LexA-DNA complex and implications for SOS box measurement.
PG  - 883-6
LID - 10.1038/nature09200 [doi]
AB  - The eubacterial SOS system is a paradigm of cellular DNA damage and repair, and 
      its activation can contribute to antibiotic resistance. Under normal conditions, 
      LexA represses the transcription of many DNA repair proteins by binding to SOS 
      'boxes' in their operators. Under genotoxic stress, accumulating complexes of 
      RecA, ATP and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) activate LexA for autocleavage. To 
      address how LexA recognizes its binding sites, we determined three crystal 
      structures of Escherichia coli LexA in complex with SOS boxes. Here we report the 
      structure of these LexA-DNA complexes. The DNA-binding domains of the LexA dimer 
      interact with the DNA in the classical fashion of a winged helix-turn-helix 
      motif. However, the wings of these two DNA-binding domains bind to the same minor 
      groove of the DNA. These wing-wing contacts may explain why the spacing between 
      the two half-sites of E. coli SOS boxes is invariant.

TI  - Three new RelE-homologous mRNA interferases of Escherichia coli differentially 
      induced by environmental stresses.

AB  - Prokaryotic toxin - antitoxin (TA) loci encode mRNA interferases that inhibit 
      translation, either by cleaving mRNA codons at the ribosomal A site or by 
      cleaving any RNA site-specifically. So far, seven mRNA interferases of 
      Escherichia coli have been identified, four of which cleave mRNA by a 
      translation-dependent mechanism. Here, we experimentally confirmed the presence 
      of three novel TA loci in E. coli. We found that the yafNO, higBA (ygjNM) and 
      ygiUT loci encode mRNA interferases related to RelE. YafO and HigB cleaved 
      translated mRNA only, while YgiU cleaved RNA site-specifically at GC[A/U], 
      independently of translation. Thus, YgiU is the first RelE-related mRNA 
      interferase that cleaves mRNA independently of translation, in vivo. All three 
      loci were induced by amino acid starvation, and inhibition of translation 
      although to different degrees. Carbon starvation induced only two of the loci. 
      The yafNO locus was induced by DNA damage, but the transcription originated from 
      the dinB promoter. Thus, our results showed that the different TA loci responded 
      differentially to environmental stresses. Induction of the three loci depended on 
      Lon protease that may sense the environmental stresses and activate TA loci by 
      cleavage of the antitoxins. Transcription of the three TA operons was 
      autoregulated by the antitoxins.

LID - 82
AB  - Bacteria respond to DNA damage by mounting a coordinated cellular response, 
      governed by the RecA and LexA proteins. In Escherichia coli, RecA stimulates 
      cleavage of the LexA repressor, inducing more than 40 genes that comprise the SOS 
      global regulatory network. The SOS response is widespread among bacteria and 
      exhibits considerable variation in its composition and regulation. In some 
      well-characterised pathogens, induction of the SOS response modulates the 
      evolution and dissemination of drug resistance, as well as synthesis, secretion 
      and dissemination of the virulence. In this review, we discuss the structure of 
      LexA protein, particularly with respect to distinct conformations that enable 
      repression of SOS genes via specific DNA binding or repressor cleavage during the 
      response to DNA damage. These may provide new starting points in the battle 
      against the emergence of bacterial pathogens and the spread of drug resistance 
      among them.

TI  - The role of SOS boxes in enteric bacteriocin regulation.
PG  - 1783-1792
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.2007/016139-0 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriocins are a large and functionally diverse family of toxins found in all 
      major lineages of Bacteria. Colicins, those bacteriocins produced by Escherichia 
      coli, serve as a model system for investigations of bacteriocin 
      structure-function relationships, genetic organization, and their ecological role 
      and evolutionary history. Colicin expression is often dependent on host 
      regulatory pathways (such as the SOS system), is usually confined to times of 
      stress, and results in death of the producing cells. This study investigates the 
      role of the SOS system in mediating this unique form of toxin expression. A 
      comparison of all the sequenced enteric bacteriocin promoters reveals that over 
      75 % are regulated by dual, overlapping SOS boxes, which serve to bind two LexA 
      repressor proteins. Furthermore, a highly conserved poly-A motif is present in 
      both of the binding sites examined, indicating enhanced affinity of the LexA 
      protein for the binding site. The use of gene expression analysis and deletion 
      mutations further demonstrates that these unique LexA cooperative binding regions 
      result in a fine tuning of bacteriocin production, limiting it to times of 
      stress. These results suggest that the evolution of dual SOS boxes elegantly 
      accomplishes the task of increasing the amount of toxin produced by a cell while 
      decreasing the rate of uninduced production, effectively reducing the cost of 
      colicin production. This hypothesis may explain why such a promoter motif is 
      present at such high frequencies in natural populations of bacteriocin-producing 
      enteric bacteria.

TI  - Genomic analysis of LexA binding reveals the permissive nature of the Escherichia 
      coli genome and identifies unconventional target sites.
PG  - 2619-30
AB  - Genomes of eukaryotic organisms are packaged into nucleosomes that restrict the 
      binding of transcription factors to accessible regions. Bacteria do not contain 
      histones, but they have nucleoid-associated proteins that have been proposed to 
      function analogously. Here, we combine chromatin immunoprecipitation and 
      high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to define the in vivo DNA targets of the 
      LexA transcriptional repressor in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate a 
      near-universal relationship between the presence of a LexA sequence motif, LexA 
      binding in vitro, and LexA binding in vivo, suggesting that a suitable 
      recognition site for LexA is sufficient for binding in vivo. Consistent with this 
      observation, LexA binds comparably to ectopic target sites introduced at various 
      positions in the genome. We also identify approximately 20 novel LexA targets 
      that lack a canonical LexA sequence motif, are not bound by LexA in vitro, and 
      presumably require an additional factor for binding in vivo. Our results indicate 
      that, unlike eukaryotic genomes, the E. coli genome is permissive to 
      transcription factor binding. The permissive nature of the E. coli genome has 
      important consequences for the nature of transcriptional regulatory proteins, 
      biological specificity, and evolution.

TI  - The small RNA IstR inhibits synthesis of an SOS-induced toxic peptide.
PG  - 2271-6
AB  - More than 60 small RNAs (sRNA) have been identified in E. coli. The functions of 
      the majority of these sRNAs are still unclear. For the few sRNAs characterized, 
      expression and functional studies indicate that they act under stress conditions. 
      Here, we describe a novel E. coli chromosome locus that is part of the SOS 
      response to DNA damage. This locus encodes two sRNAs, IstR-1 and IstR-2, and a 
      toxic peptide, TisB, encoded by tisAB mRNA. Transcription of tisAB and istR-2 is 
      SOS regulated, whereas IstR-1 is present throughout growth. IstR-1 inhibits 
      toxicity by base-pairing to a short region in the tisAB mRNA. This antisense 
      interaction entails RNase III-dependent cleavage, thereby inactivating the mRNA 
      for translation. In the absence of the SOS response, IstR-1 is present in high 
      excess over its target. However, SOS induction leads to depletion of the IstR-1 
      pool, concomitant with accumulation of tisAB mRNA. Under such conditions, TisB 
      exerts its toxic effect, slowing down growth. We propose that the inhibitory sRNA 
      prevents inadvertent TisB synthesis during normal growth and, possibly, also 
      limits SOS-induced toxicity. Our study adds the SOS regulon to the growing list 
      of global regulatory circuits controlled by sRNA genes.

TI  - Reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the LexA-binding sequence.
PG  - 3783-3795
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.27315-0 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, the recognition sequence of the SOS repressor LexA protein has 
      been identified for several bacterial clades, such as the Gram-positive, green 
      non-sulfur bacteria and Cyanobacteria phyla, or the 'Alphaproteobacteria', 
      'Deltaproteobacteria' and 'Gammaproteobacteria' classes. Nevertheless, the 
      evolutionary relationship among these sequences and the proteins that recognize 
      them has not been analysed. Fibrobacter succinogenes is an anaerobic 
      Gram-negative bacterium that branched from a common bacterial ancestor 
      immediately before the Proteobacteria phylum. Taking advantage of its 
      intermediate position in the phylogenetic tree, and in an effort to reconstruct 
      the evolutionary history of LexA-binding sequences, the F. succinogenes lexA gene 
      has been isolated and its product purified to identify its DNA recognition motif 
      through electrophoretic mobility assays and footprinting experiments. After 
      comparing the available LexA DNA-binding sequences with the F. succinogenes one, 
      reported here, directed mutagenesis of the F. succinogenes LexA-binding sequence 
      and phylogenetic analyses of LexA proteins have revealed the existence of two 
      independent evolutionary lanes for the LexA recognition motif that emerged from 
      the Gram-positive box: one generating the Cyanobacteria and 'Alphaproteobacteria' 
      LexA-binding sequences, and the other giving rise to the F. succinogenes and 
      Myxococcus xanthus ones, in a transitional step towards the current 
      'Gammaproteobacteria' LexA box. The contrast between the results reported here 
      and the phylogenetic data available in the literature suggests that, some time 
      after its emergence as a distinct bacterial class, the 'Alphaproteobacteria' lost 
      its vertically received lexA gene, but received later through lateral gene 
      transfer a new lexA gene belonging to either a cyanobacterium or a bacterial 
      species closely related to this phylum. This constitutes the first report based 
      on experimental evidence of lateral gene transfer in the evolution of a gene 
      governing such a complex regulatory network as the bacterial SOS system.

TI  - Crystal structure of LexA: a conformational switch for regulation of 
      self-cleavage.
PG  - 585-94
AB  - LexA repressor undergoes a self-cleavage reaction. In vivo, this reaction 
      requires an activated form of RecA, but it occurs spontaneously in vitro at high 
      pH. Accordingly, LexA must both allow self-cleavage and yet prevent this reaction 
      in the absence of a stimulus. We have solved the crystal structures of several 
      mutant forms of LexA. Strikingly, two distinct conformations are observed, one 
      compatible with cleavage, and the other in which the cleavage site is 
      approximately 20 A from the catalytic center. Our analysis provides insight into 
      the structural and energetic features that modulate the interconversion between 
      these two forms and hence the rate of the self-cleavage reaction. We suggest RecA 
      activates the self-cleavage of LexA and related proteins through selective 
      stabilization of the cleavable conformation.

TI  - The SOS promoter dinH is essential for ftsK transcription during cell division.
PG  - 2891-2899
LID - 10.1099/00221287-146-11-2891 [doi]
AB  - The formation of the Escherichia coli division septum has been well characterized 
      and the majority of the genes involved have been shown to map to the dcw cluster. 
      One exception is ftsK, which lies at 20 minutes, immediately downstream of the 
      global response regulatory gene, lrp. The promoter for ftsK has not yet been 
      assigned. Here, it is reported that ftsK is transcribed from two promoters; the 
      first is located within the lrp reading frame and is dispensable whilst the 
      second is essential and corresponds to dinH, previously characterized as an SOS 
      promoter regulated by LexA. ftsK is the first essential gene to be described that 
      is controlled by an SOS-inducible promoter. A possible mechanism by which dinH 
      may be activated in recA minus strains, or in strains with uncleavable LexA, is 
      discussed.

TI  - Identification of additional genes belonging to the LexA regulon in Escherichia 
      coli.
PG  - 1560-72
AB  - Exposure of Escherichia coli to a variety of DNA-damaging agents results in the 
      induction of the global 'SOS response'. Expression of many of the genes in the 
      SOS regulon are controlled by the LexA protein. LexA acts as a transcriptional 
      repressor of these unlinked genes by binding to specific sequences (LexA boxes) 
      located within the promoter region of each LexA-regulated gene. Alignment of 20 
      LexA binding sites found in the E. coli chromosome reveals a consensus of 
      5'-TACTG(TA)5CAGTA-3'. DNA sequences that exhibit a close match to the consensus 
      are said to have a low heterology index and bind LexA tightly, whereas those that 
      are more diverged have a high heterology index and are not expected to bind LexA. 
      By using this heterology index, together with other search criteria, such as the 
      location of the putative LexA box relative to a gene or to promoter elements, we 
      have performed computational searches of the entire E. coli genome to identify 
      novel LexA-regulated genes. These searches identified a total of 69 potential 
      LexA-regulated genes/operons with a heterology index of <15 and included all 
      previously characterized LexA-regulated genes. Probes were made to the remaining 
      genes, and these were screened by Northern analysis for damage-inducible gene 
      expression in a wild-type lexA+ cell, constitutive expression in a lexA(Def) cell 
      and basal expression in a non-inducible lexA(Ind-) cell. These experiments have 
      allowed us to identify seven new LexA-regulated genes, thus bringing the present 
      number of genes in the E. coli LexA regulon to 31. The potential function of each 
      newly identified LexA-regulated gene is discussed.

TI  - LexA repressor forms stable dimers in solution. The role of specific dna in 
      tightening protein-protein interactions.
PG  - 4708-12
AB  - Cooperativity in the interactions among proteins subunits and DNA is crucial for 
      DNA recognition. LexA repressor was originally thought to bind DNA as a monomer, 
      with cooperativity leading to tighter binding of the second monomer. The main 
      support for this model was a high value of the dissociation constant for the LexA 
      dimer (micromolar range). Here we show that the protein is a dimer at nanomolar 
      concentrations under different conditions. The reversible dissociation of LexA 
      dimer was investigated by the effects of hydrostatic pressure or urea, using 
      fluorescence emission and polarization to monitor the dissociation process. The 
      dissociation constant lies in the picomolar range (lower than 20 pM). LexA 
      monomers associate with an unusual large volume change (340 ml/mol), indicating 
      the burial of a large surface area upon dimerization. Whereas nonspecific DNA has 
      no stabilizing effect, specific DNA induces tightening of the dimer and a 
      750-fold decrease in the K(d). In contrast to the previous model, a tight dimer 
      rather than a monomer is the functional repressor. Accordingly, the LexA dimer 
      only loses its ability to recognize a specific DNA sequence by RecA-induced 
      autoproteolysis. Our work provides insights into the linkage between 
      protein-protein interactions, DNA recognition, and DNA repair.

TI  - Regulation of transcription of cell division genes in the Escherichia coli dcw 
      cluster.
PG  - 317-24
AB  - The Escherichia coli dcw cluster contains cell division genes, such as the 
      phylogenetically ubiquitous ftsZ, and genes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. 
      Transcription in the cluster proceeds in the same direction as the progress of 
      the replication fork along the chromosome. Regulation is exerted at the 
      transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The absence of transcriptional 
      termination signals may, in principle, allow extension of the transcripts 
      initiated at the up-stream promoter (mraZ1p) even to the furthest down-stream 
      gene (envA). Complementation tests suggest that they extend into ftsW in the 
      central part of the cluster. In addition, the cluster contains other promoters 
      individually regulated by cis- and trans-acting signals. Dissociation of the 
      expression of the ftsZ gene, located after ftsQ and A near the 3' end of the 
      cluster, from its natural regulatory signals leads to an alteration in the 
      physiology of cell division. The complexities observed in the regulation of gene 
      expression in the cluster may then have an important biological role. Among them, 
      LexA-binding SOS boxes have been found at the 5' end of the cluster, preceding 
      promoters which direct the expression of ftsI (coding for PBP3, the 
      penicillin-binding protein involved in septum formation). A gearbox promoter, 
      ftsQ1p, forms part of the signals regulating the transcription of ftsQ, A and Z. 
      It is an inversely growth-dependent mechanism driven by RNA polymerase containing 
      sigma s, the factor involved in the expression of stationary phase-specific 
      genes. Although the dcw cluster is conserved to a different extent in a variety 
      of bacteria, the regulation of gene expression, the presence or absence of 
      individual genes, and even the essentiality of some of them, show variations in 
      the phylogenetic scale which may reflect adaptation to specific life cycles.

TI  - Identification of yebG as a DNA damage-inducible Escherichia coli gene.
PG  - 119-22
AB  - The nucleotide sequence upstream of the Escherichia coli yebG gene presents 
      features similar to those found in SOS system regulatory sites (putative SOS box, 
      -10 and -35 promoter boxes and a ribosome binding site). Operon fusion assays 
      demonstrate now that this region controls transcription in a recA-, 
      lexA-dependent way and that the reporter gene expression is inducible by DNA 
      damage consequent to mitomycin C treatment. Increased expression does not result 
      from an increase in plasmid copy number. These results indicate that yebG is a 
      novel SOS regulon gene. The yebG product is predicted to be a 96 amino acid 
      residue, 10.7 kDa protein whose function is not yet known. Unlike other SOS 
      genes, the construct carrying the yebG regulatory region is not stationary phase 
      inducible.

TI  - Multicopy suppressors of the cold-sensitive phenotype of the pcsA68 (dinD68) 
      mutation in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 3854-9
AB  - The Escherichia coli strain cs2-68 is a cold-sensitive (c) mutant that forms a 
      long filamentous cell at 20 degrees C with a large nucleoid mass in its central 
      region. We have recently shown that the pcsA68 mutation causing the cs phenotype 
      is a single-base substitution within the dinD gene, a DNA damage-inducible gene 
      which maps at 82 min. Since null mutants of the pcsA (dinD) gene are viable, with 
      no discernible defect in cell growth, the cs phenotype is attributed to a toxic 
      effect by the mutant protein. In an attempt to identify a target(s) for the toxic 
      pcsA68 mutant protein, we screened for chromosomal fragments on multicopy 
      plasmids that could suppress the cs phenotype. Three different BamHI fragments 
      were found to suppress cold sensitivity, and the lexA, dinG, and dinI genes were 
      identified to be responsible for the suppression in each fragment. DinG shares 
      multiple motifs with many DNA helicases. The complete sequence of dinI revealed 
      that DinI is a small protein of 81 amino acids. It is similar in size and 
      sequence to ImpC of the Salmonella typhimurium plasmid TP110 and to a protein 
      (ORFfs) of the retronphage phi R67, both of which are also under the control of 
      LexA.

TI  - Evolution of transcriptional regulation system through promiscuous coupling of 
      regulatory proteins with operons; suggestion from protein sequence similarities 
      in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 183-204
AB  - As an advanced molecular study of the problems of the evolution of organisms, the 
      transcriptional regulation system is studied by investigating the amino acid 
      sequence similarities between the proteins in the regulation system of 
      Escherichia coli in which the data of sequenced proteins as well as of 
      regulator-regulon relationships are accumulated. The similarities between the 
      proteins are calculated by the FASTA algorithm and their homology is also 
      evaluated in terms of statistical significance with the use of the RDF2 program. 
      This investigation reveals that the similarity between the regulatory protein and 
      the regulated protein is hardly found, but many similarities are found between 
      regulatory proteins and between regulated proteins. These similarity relations 
      are compared with the regulator-regulon relationships ascertained experimentally. 
      From this comparison, it is found that similar regulatory proteins rarely 
      regulate the transcription of similar protein genes. As most of the highly 
      similar proteins are considered to have diverged from a common ancestral protein, 
      this finding strongly suggests the possibility that descendant regulatory 
      proteins have been promiscuously coupled with descendant operons, independently 
      of their ancestral regulator-regulon relationship, and that some of the couplings 
      have been fixed by selection to form the present system of transcriptional 
      regulation. The compatibility of such promiscuous coupling with regulatory 
      organization is illustrated in the carbohydrate transport systems and the 
      succeeding metabolic pathways, whose organization is comprehensive in sending 
      nutritious substances to the central path of glycolysis under different 
      environmental conditions. The benefit of flexibility in regulator-regulon 
      relationships in evolutionary processes is also discussed in connection with the 
      punctuational divergence of species in macroevolution and the cell 
      differentiation in multicellular organisms.

TI  - sbmC, a stationary-phase induced SOS Escherichia coli gene, whose product 
      protects cells from the DNA replication inhibitor microcin B17.
PG  - 301-11
AB  - Microcin B17 (MccB17) is a ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotic of 43 amino 
      acids that induces double-strand breaking of DNA in a DNA gyrase-dependent 
      reaction. As a consequence, the SOS regulon is induced and massive DNA 
      degradation occurs. In this work we have characterized an Escherichia coli gene, 
      sbmC, that in high copy number determines high cell resistance to MccB17. sbmC 
      encodes a cytoplasmic polypeptide of 157 amino acids (M(r), 18,095) that has been 
      visualized in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gene is located at min 44 of the E. 
      coli genetic map, close to the sbcB gene. sbmC expression is induced by 
      DNA-damaging agents and, also, by the entry of cells into the stationary growth 
      phase. A G-->T transversion at the fifth nucleotide of the quasicanonical 
      LexA-box preceding the gene makes recA cells 16-fold more resistant to exogenous 
      MccB17. The gene product, SbmC, also blocks MccB17 export from producing cells. 
      Altogether, our results suggest that SbmC recognizes and sequesters MccB17 in a 
      reversible way.

TI  - Promoters of the phr gene in Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 52-8
AB  - We have identified two promoters of the Escherichia coli phr gene by DNA deletion 
      mapping, S1 mapping of transcripts and sequence homology. The weaker promoter, 
      P2, located approximately 530 bp upstream from the start codon, extends beyond 
      the previously known nucleotide sequence. The stronger, P1, lies 90 bp from the 
      gene and is distinct from three previously described promoter-like sequences 
      nearby. beta-Galactosidase production from a plasmid-borne gene, promoted by a 
      synthetic copy of P1, increases after DNA damage, but the increase does not 
      depend on the SOS-box-like sequences normally present in the vicinity of P1. 
      Induction still requires intact recA and lexA genes, and also intact sulA.

TI  - dinP, a new gene in Escherichia coli, whose product shows similarities to UmuC 
      and its homologues.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - A new gene, designated dinP, was found during E. coli genomic sequencing around 
      the 5.5 min region. Its coding region is preceded by a sequence similar to the 
      consensus binding sequence for LexA, the so-called SOS box sequence. The amino 
      acid sequence of DinP (351 amino acid residues) has a strong similarity to the C. 
      elegans hypothetical protein F22B7.6 and weaker similarities to the UmuC 
      homologues in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium and also to REV1 of 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Another SOS operon (dinJ1 and dinJ2 genes) found in 
      this region is also described.

TI  - The pcsA gene is identical to dinD in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 156-65
AB  - The pcsA68 mutant of Escherichia coli is a cold-sensitive mutant which forms long 
      filaments with a large nucleoid in the central region at 20 degrees C. We here 
      show that (i) the coding region for the pcsA gene is identical with orfY located 
      upstream of pyrE and can be deleted without loss of viability; (ii) pcsA is also 
      identical to dinD, a DNA damage-inducible gene, whose expression is regulated by 
      the LexA-RecA system; (iii) the cold-sensitive phenotype of the pcsA68 mutation 
      is suppressed by delta recA or lexA1 (Ind-) mutation, but not by sulA 
      inactivation; (iv) overproduction of PcsA68 leads to inhibition of cell growth in 
      recA+ and delta recA strains at 20 and 37 degrees C, but PcsA+ does not show such 
      an effect at any temperature; (v) SOS response is induced in the pcsA68 mutant 
      cells at 20 degrees C. We discuss the possible function of the pcsA gene, 
      comparing it with the sulA or the dif-xerCD function. We also describe a new 
      method for gene disruption with positive and negative selection.

TI  - Solution structure of the LexA repressor DNA binding domain determined by 1H NMR 
      spectroscopy.
PG  - 3936-44
AB  - The structure of the 84 residue DNA binding domain of the Escherichia coli LexA 
      repressor has been determined from NMR data using distance geometry and 
      restrained molecular dynamics. The assignment of the 1H NMR spectrum of the 
      molecule, derived from 2- and 3-D homonuclear experiments, is also reported. A 
      total of 613 non-redundant distance restraints were used to give a final family 
      of 28 structures. The structured region of the molecule consisted of residues 
      4-69 and yielded a r.m.s. deviation from an average of 0.9 A for backbone and 1.6 
      A for all heavy atoms. The structure contains three regular alpha-helices at 
      residues 6-21 (I), 28-35 (II) and 41-52 (III), and an antiparallel beta-sheet at 
      residues 56-58 and 66-68. Helices II and III form a variant helix-turn-helix DNA 
      binding motif, with an unusual one residue insert at residue 38. The topology of 
      the LexA DNA binding domain is found to be the same as for the DNA binding 
      domains of the catabolic activator protein, human histone 5, the HNF-3/fork head 
      protein and the Kluyveromyces lactis heat shock transcription factor.

TI  - Identification of high affinity binding sites for LexA which define new DNA 
      damage-inducible genes in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 507-23
AB  - A multi-step screening procedure was devised to identify new operators for the 
      LexA repressor in the sequenced portions of the genomes of Escherichia coli and 
      its plasmids and bacteriophages. Sequence analysis methods were employed 
      initially to distinguish true LexA operators from "operator-like" sequences 
      stored within the GenBank and EMBL databases. The affinity of purified LexA 
      protein for cloned DNA fragments containing several of the prospective new sites 
      was then assessed using quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assays and 
      site-directed mutagenesis. Calculated binding affinities were compared directly 
      with values determined for known and mutant LexA operators in concurrent 
      experiments. Three E. coli chromosomal segments (near pyrC, hsdS and ntrla) and 
      two bacteriophage sequences (near the P1 cre and lambda oop genes) bound LexA 
      protein specifically. These sites and most others identified in the screening are 
      located immediately upstream of known genes and/or large open reading frames. 
      These results and additional transcription data demonstrate that several of the 
      sequences define new DNA damage-inducible (din) genes and include the previously 
      uncharacterized dinD locus. Furthermore, the search identified an SOS gene within 
      the genome of P1 which encodes a protein that is homologous to UmuD', the 
      RecA-promoted cleavage product of the umuD gene. The success of the combinatorial 
      approach described here suggests that analogous searches for new regulatory 
      sequences within the E. coli genome and the genomes of other organisms will also 
      yield favorable results.

TI  - Analysis of the Escherichia coli genome. IV. DNA sequence of the region from 89.2 
      to 92.8 minutes.
PG  - 5408-17
AB  - We present the sequence of 176 kilobases of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome, 
      from katG at 89.2 to an open reading frame (ORF) of unknown function at 92.8 
      minutes on the genetic map. This brings the total of contiguous sequence from the 
      E. coli genome project to 500 kb (81.5 to 92.8 minutes). This segment contains 
      134 putative coding genes (ORFs) of which 66 genes were previously identified. 
      Eight new genes--acs, pepE, and nrfB-G--were identified as well as the previously 
      mapped gldA and alr genes. Still, 58 ORFs remain unidentified despite literature 
      and similarity searches. The arrangement of proposed genes relative to possible 
      promoters and terminators suggests 55 potential transcription units. Other 
      features include 13 REP elements, one IRU (ERIC) repeat, 59 computer-predicted 
      bends, 42 Chi sites and one new grey hole. Sixteen signal peptides were found, 
      including those of lamB, btuB, and malE. Two ribosomal RNA loci, rrnB and rrnE, 
      are located in this segment, so we have now sequenced four of the seven E. coli 
      rRNA loci. Comparison of the rRNA loci reveals some differences in the ribosomal 
      structural RNAs which are generally compatible with the proposed secondary 
      structures.

TI  - Interaction of LexA repressor with the asymmetric dinG operator and complete 
      nucleotide sequence of the gene.
PG  - 5110-6
AB  - The dinG gene was originally isolated during a search for Escherichia coli 
      promoters which are components of the SOS regulon. The regulatory region of this 
      gene contains a potential binding site for LexA repressor which is quite 
      different from other known sites. All previously described chromosomal LexA 
      operators are imperfect palindromes containing the sequence CTG(N10)CAG. The 
      noncanonical dinG sequence breaks the symmetry and takes the form TTG(N10)CAG. In 
      the present study, a search for mutations within dinGop::galK fusion plasmids 
      which render transcription independent of intracellular levels of LexA has 
      yielded mutations only within this 16-bp sequence. Electrophoretic mobility shift 
      assays performed with purified mutant and wild-type operator fragments revealed 
      that the affinity of LexA for each of the mutant sites is greatly reduced 
      compared with that of the wild type. One of the mutants contained an alteration 
      in the putative promoter of dinG which increased the similarity of the -35 region 
      to the consensus sequence (TTGGCT----TTGACT); the apparent promoter activity of 
      this construct was subsequently found to be approximately eight times higher than 
      that of the wild type in vivo. Additional experiments have established the 
      complete nucleotide sequence of the dinG gene. A long open reading frame located 
      immediately downstream of the asymmetric operator segment which could potentially 
      encode a 72.9-kDa DinG protein was identified.

      promoters which are components of the SOS regulon. Plasmids containing the 
      regulatory regions of polB (dinA) and two new loci, dinG and dinH, were 
      characterized. Galactokinase gene fusion experiments indicated that transcription 
      of these genes is inducible by treatment with mitomycin and conforms to a 
      classical model of SOS regulation involving simple LexA repression. Mapping 
      studies using the E. coli DNA library of Kohara et al. (Y. Kohara, K. Akiyama, 
      and K. Isono, Cell 50:495-508, 1987) revealed that dinG and dinH are located at 
      17.8 and 19.8 min on the chromosome, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of the 
      dinH regulatory region contains a segment which is very similar to previously 
      characterized binding sites for LexA protein. An asymmetric, noncanonical 20-bp 
      LexA operator in the cloned dinG promoter region was identified. Additional 
      experiments have revealed that the nucleotide sequence of the gene immediately 
      downstream of the DNA damage-inducible polB locus encodes a polypeptide which has 
      extensive sequence homology to several known and putative DNA and RNA helicase 
      proteins. This gene, which is not regulated by the LexA repressor, has been 
      designated hepA. The predicted amino acid sequence of the product of hepA 
      contains several highly conserved sequence motifs that are also found in enzymes 
      such as the RecQ and UvrB proteins of E. coli and the Rad3 protein of 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

TI  - Mechanism of specific LexA cleavage: autodigestion and the role of RecA 
      coprotease.
PG  - 411-21
AB  - Specific LexA cleavage can occur under two different conditions: RecA-mediated 
      cleavage requires an activated form of RecA, while an intramolecular 
      self-cleavage termed autodigestion proceeds spontaneously at high pH and does not 
      involve RecA. The two cleavage reactions are closely related. We postulate that 
      RecA stimulates autodigestion rather than acting as a typical protease, and it is 
      proposed to term this activity 'RecA coprotease' to emphasize this indirect role. 
      The mechanism of autodigestion is similar to that of a serine protease, and RecA 
      appears to act by reducing the pKa of a critical lysine residue LexA. A new class 
      of mutants, termed lexA (IndS), is described; these mutations increase the rate 
      of LexA cleavage.

PG  - 39-41
AB  - We have studied the in vitro interaction of the LexA repressor protein and the 
      uvrC regulatory region. We find that there is specific binding to two regions, 
      the region we have defined as lexA1 and the lexA2-lexA3 region. Our findings 
      support the possibility of an inducible regulation for this complex operon.

TI  - The LexA protein does not bind specifically to the two SOS box-like sequences 
      immediately 5' to the phr gene.
PG  - 207-10
AB  - There are two SOS box-like sequences located at the regions -161 to -142 and -69 
      to -50 with regard to the initiation codon of phr. Ihara et al. (1987) 
      constructed a phr'-'lacZ fusion plasmid in which these sequences and the amino 
      terminal end of the phr gene was fused to lacZ and therefore lacZ was under the 
      regulatory control of phr promoter-operator. The authors found that in cells 
      carrying this plasmid beta-galactosidase was inducible by UV and UV-mimetic 
      agents and concluded that phr was controlled by the LexA repressor. We wished to 
      confirm these results by theoretical analysis of the SOS-like sequences by the 
      method developed by Berg (1987) as well as by measuring the binding of LexA 
      protein to the putative SOS boxes by a novel gel retardation assay. Both 
      theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the putative SOS 
      boxes immediately 5' to phr have no specific affinity for LexA protein.

TI  - New mutations fts-36, lts-33, and ftsW clustered in the mra region of the 
      Escherichia coli chromosome induce thermosensitive cell growth and division.
PG  - 5523-30
AB  - Three new mutants of Escherichia coli showing thermosensitive cell growth and 
      division were isolated, and the mutations were mapped to the mra region at 2 min 
      on the E. coli chromosome map distal to leuA. Two mutations were mapped closely 
      upstream of ftsI (also called pbpB), in a region of 600 bases; the fts-36 mutant 
      showed thermosensitive growth and formed filamentous cells at 42 degrees C, 
      whereas the lts-33 mutant lysed at 42 degrees C without forming filamentous 
      cells. The mutation in the third new thermosensitive, filament-forming mutant, 
      named ftsW, was mapped between murF and murG. By isolation of these three 
      mutants, about 90% of the 17-kilobase region from fts-36-lts-33 to envA could be 
      filled with genes for cell division and growth, and the genes could be aligned.

TI  - The amino-terminal domain of LexA repressor is alpha-helical but differs from 
      canonical helix-turn-helix proteins: a two-dimensional 1H NMR study.
PG  - 6863-7
AB  - The amino-terminal DNA binding domain of LexA repressor consisting of 84 amino 
      acid residues has been studied by two-dimensional 1H NMR. Sequence-specific 1H 
      resonance assignments were made for the first 60 amino acid residues. The 
      secondary structure of this part of the protein contains three alpha-helices in 
      the peptide segments 8-20, 28-35, and 41-54. The last helix has a distortion 
      around residues 47-48. The peptide segment 28-47 shows weak homology with other 
      helix-turn-helix proteins. To investigate the spatial structure of this region of 
      the molecule distance-geometry calculations were performed based on proton-proton 
      distance constraints from nuclear Overhauser effects. The resulting structure 
      shows that the segment 28-47 contains two helices with a loop region between 
      them. The relative orientation of the two helices is similar to that found in 
      helix-turn-helix proteins, but the helices are further apart, with the phenyl 
      ring of Phe-37 located between them. The Brookhaven Protein Data Bank was 
      searched for structurally homologous peptide segments in other proteins. The 
      result of this search was that the two-helical structure of LexA is not more 
      closely related to the canonical helix-turn-helix motif than it is to similar 
      substructures found in other classes of proteins.

TI  - Structure and regulation of the Escherichia coli ruv operon involved in DNA 
      repair and recombination.
PG  - 4322-9
AB  - The ruv gene of Escherichia coli, which is involved in DNA repair and 
      recombination, was cloned on a plasmid vector. The DNA of the ruv region was 
      sequenced; it had two open reading frames in tandem that could code for 22- and 
      37-kilodalton proteins. The proteins encoded by these open reading frames were 
      identified by the maxicell method. The two genes were aligned in the same 
      orientation and regulated by the SOS system, so the two genes probably constitute 
      an operon. The distal one complemented the ruv mutations. Transcription of the 
      operon was studied both in vivo and in vitro. Two transcription initiation sites 
      were identified upstream of the coding frames, and the transcription from both 
      sites was repressed by the LexA repressor. A DNA sequence that is homologous to 
      the SOS box and bound by LexA protein was found in the regulatory region of the 
      operon. The amino acid sequence of Ruv protein deduced from the DNA sequence 
      shows a high degree of homology to the consensus sequence shared by ATP-binding 
      proteins.

TI  - The carboxy-terminal domain of the LexA repressor oligomerises essentially as the 
      entire protein.
PG  - 56-60
AB  - The ability of the isolated carboxy-terminal domain of the LexA repressor of 
      Escherichia coli to form dimers and tetramers has been investigated by 
      equilibrium ultracentrifugation. This domain, that comprises the amino acids 
      85-202, is readily purified after self-cleavage of the LexA repressor at alkaline 
      pH. It turns out that the carboxy-terminal domain forms dimers and tetramers 
      essentially as the entire LexA repressor. The corresponding association constants 
      were determined after non-linear least squares fitting of the experimental 
      concentration distribution. A dimer association constant of K2 = 3 X 10(4) M-1 
      and a tetramer association constant of K4 = 2 X 10(4) M-1 have been determined. 
      Similar measurements on the entire LexA repressor [(1985) Biochemistry 24, 
      2812-2818] gave values of K2 = 2.1 X 10(4) M-1 and K4 = 7.7 X 10(4) M-1. Within 
      experimental error the dimer formation constant of the carboxy-terminal domain 
      may be considered to be the same as that of the entire repressor whereas the 
      isolated domain forms tetramers slightly less efficiently. It should be stressed 
      that the potential error in K4 is higher than that in K2. The overall conclusion 
      is that the two structural domains of LexA have also well-defined functional 
      roles: the amino-terminal domain interacts with DNA and the carboxy-terminal 
      domain is involved in dimerisation reinforcing in this way the binding of the 
      LexA repressor to operator DNA.

TI  - Nucleotide sequencing of the ruv region of Escherichia coli K-12 reveals a LexA 
      regulated operon encoding two genes.
PG  - 1541-9
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2505 bp region of the Escherichia coli chromosome 
      containing the LexA regulated ruv gene has been determined. A sequence of 1631 bp 
      encoding two non-overlapping open reading frames that constitute a single operon 
      and which specify polypeptides with predicted molecular weights of 22172 daltons 
      and 37177 daltons respectively, was identified as the most probable sequence for 
      ruv. Each of the two open reading frames, designated ruvA and ruvB, is preceded 
      by a reasonable Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Two 16 bp sequences (SOS boxes) that 
      match the consensus sequence for binding LexA protein are located 5' to ruvA in a 
      region that provides a possible single promoter for expression of both ruvA and 
      ruvB, with the second SOS box overlapping the putative -35 region. A possible 
      transcriptional terminator is located 137 bp downstream of ruvB. The amino acid 
      sequence predicted for RuvB contains a region that matches a highly conserved 
      sequence found in several DNA repair and recombination proteins that bind ATP.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence and LexA regulation of the Escherichia coli recN gene.
PG  - 5041-9
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2224 bp region of the Escherichia coli chromosome 
      that carries the LexA regulated recN gene has been determined. A region of 1701 
      nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 567 amino acids with a predicted molecular 
      weight of 63,599 was identified as the most probable sequence for the recN 
      structural gene. The proposed initiation codon is preceded by a reasonable 
      Shine-Dalgarno sequence and a promoter region containing two 16 bp sequences, 
      separated by 6 bp, that match the consensus sequence (SOS box) for binding LexA 
      protein. DNA fragments containing this putative promoter region are shown to bind 
      LexA in vitro and to have LexA-regulated promoter activity in vivo. The amino 
      acid sequence of RecN predicted from the DNA contains a region that is homologous 
      to highly conserved sequences found in several DNA repair enzymes and other 
      proteins that bind ATP. A sequence of 9 amino acids was found to be homologous to 
      a region of the RecA protein of E. coli postulated to have a role in 
      DNA/nucleotide binding.

TI  - The recQ gene of Escherichia coli K12: primary structure and evidence for SOS 
      regulation.
PG  - 298-304
AB  - A 2,695 bp chromosomal segment of Escherichia coli K12 containing the recQ gene 
      was sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed an open reading frame thought to 
      represent recQ, with a clockwise direction of transcription relative to the 
      standard genetic map of E. coli K12 and having a coding capacity for a protein of 
      Mr 68,350. The -10 region of the presumptive recQ promoter overlapped the 
      putative terminator for the upstream gene pldA, and was immediately followed by a 
      15 bp stretch of DNA bearing a strong resemblance to the reported sequences of 
      LexA repressor binding sites. This latter finding suggested the possibility of 
      SOS regulation of recQ gene expression, which was substantiated by experiments 
      with recQ-lacZ fusions.

TI  - Activation of the parathyroid hormone receptor-adenylate cyclase system in 
      osteosarcoma cells by a human renal carcinoma factor.
PG  - 5358-63
AB  - Human renal carcinoma cell line 786-0 elaborates a protein that is structurally 
      and immunochemically distinct from parathyroid hormone (PTH) and that activates 
      renal cortical adenylate cyclase via an interaction with the PTH receptor. 
      Because of the high frequency of excessive bone resorption and resultant 
      hypercalcemia in patients with malignant disease we evaluated the ability of this 
      786-0 cell factor to reproduce PTH action in bone-derived cells. The 786-0 factor 
      as well as bovine PTH (BPTH) (1-34) and prostaglandin E1 produced marked 
      increases in cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in the 
      clonal rat osteosarcoma cell line UMR-106. A competitive antagonist of PTH 
      action, [norleucine8, norleucine18, tyrosine34] BPTH(3-34)amide, blocked the cAMP 
      stimulation produced by 786-0 factor and BPTH(1-34) but not that produced by 
      prostaglandin E1. In the presence of forskolin (0.1 microM) UMR-106 cells were 
      extremely sensitive to 786-0 factor, showing significant increases in cAMP 
      production at a concentration 10-fold less than that required to activate 
      adenylate cyclase in renal membranes. In contrast UMR-106 cells were less 
      sensitive to BPTH(1-34) than were renal membranes. This preferential increase in 
      sensitivity to 786-0 factor was not seen in membranes prepared from UMR-106 cells 
      suggesting the importance of cytosolic components. Six additional human 
      genitourinary carcinoma cell lines were found to produce factors that increased 
      cAMP levels in UMR-106 cells. We conclude that 786-0 factor is a potent activator 
      of the PTH receptor-adenylate cyclase system in these bone-derived cells. These 
      findings are consistent with the view that cancer-associated hypercalcemia may 
      frequently be attributable to tumor secretion of proteins (such as 786-0 factor) 
      that are distinct from PTH but are capable of activating skeletal PTH receptors.

TI  - Analysis of the regulatory region of the ssb gene of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5095-109
AB  - The regulation of the ssb gene of E. coli has been studied. We reported earlier 
      that the SOS box of the neighbouring uvrA gene also controls the transcription of 
      the ssb gene. Detailed analysis of the upstream region of ssb by S1 mapping 
      reveals the existence of three in vivo functional promoters of which the most 
      upstream one (PI) is inducible by DNA damage. Measurement of galactokinase 
      synthesis using galK fusion plasmids indicates that the uninduced level of 
      transcription from the PI promoter is low. Ssb multicopy plasmids lacking the PI 
      promoter still complement the UV sensitivity of an Ssb mutant. The role of the 
      three promoters in the regulation of the level of Ssb protein in the cell, is 
      discussed.

TI  - Structural analysis of the umu operon required for inducible mutagenesis in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 4336-40
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.8-kilobase fragment of the Escherichia coli 
      chromosome containing the umuDC genes has been determined. The DNA sequence 
      specifies two open reading frames of 417 and 1266 nucleotides encoding proteins 
      with calculated molecular weights of 15,063 and 47,677, respectively. From these 
      and the previous results of genetic and biochemical studies on the cloned genes, 
      we conclude that the former is the umuD and the latter is the umuC gene. In vitro 
      transcription of the regulatory region of the umu operon revealed that (i) 
      upstream of the coding region there is a promoter-operator complex having the 
      consensus sequence, CTGTATATAAAAACAG, of an SOS box, (ii) transcription of the 
      umu operon begins at an adenine residue in the SOS box, and (iii) the LexA 
      protein binds to the operator region, with an equilibrium dissociation constant 
      (Kd) of 0.2, thereby repressing the transcription of the umuDC genes. These 
      results indicate that the expression of the umu operon is under the coordinated 
      control of the recA lexA gene products.

PG  - 343-7
AB  - In the bacterium Escherichia coli DNA damaging treatments such as ultraviolet or 
      ionizing radiation induce a set of functions called collectively the SOS 
      response, reviewed here. The regulation of the SOS response involves a repressor, 
      the LexA protein, and an inducer, the RecA protein. After DNA damage an effector 
      molecule is produced--possibly single stranded DNA--which activates the RecA 
      protein to a form capable of catalysing proteolytic cleavage of LexA. The 
      repressors of certain temperate prophages are cleaved under the same conditions, 
      resulting in lysogenic induction. SOS functions are involved in DNA repair and 
      mutagenesis, in cell division inhibition, in recovery of normal physiological 
      conditions after the DNA damage is repaired, and possibly in cell death when DNA 
      damage is too extensive. The SOS response also includes several chromosomal genes 
      of unknown function, a number of plasmid encoded genes (bacteriocins, 
      mutagenesis), and lysogenic induction of certain prophages. DNA damaging 
      treatments seem to induce DNA repair and mutagenic activities and proviral 
      development in many species, including mammalian cells. In general, substances 
      which are genotoxic to higher eukaryotes induce the SOS response in bacteria. 
      This correlation is the basis of the numerous bacterial tests for genotoxicity 
      and carcinogenicity.

TI  - Promotion, termination, and anti-termination in the rpsU-dnaG-rpoD macromolecular 
      synthesis operon of E. coli K-12.
PG  - 391-401
AB  - The regulatory regions for the rpsU-dnaG-rpoD macromolecular synthesis operon 
      have been fused to a structural gene whose product is readily assayed (the Cmr 
      structural gene coding for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, CAT). The 
      promoters (P1, P2, P3, Pa, Pb, Phs) for the macromolecular synthesis operon have 
      different strengths as shown by their relative abilities to drive expression of 
      the CAT gene. Promoter occlusion by P1 can be demonstrated within this operon. 
      Regions 5kb upstream have a profound effect on operon gene expression. There is a 
      thermoinducible promoter located within the dnaG structural gene. One of the 
      macromolecular synthesis operon promoters is under lexA control. Although the 
      operon structure allows coordinate expression of rpsU, dnaG and rpoD these 
      additional features suggest that expression of individual genes can be 
      independently regulated in response to altered growth conditions.

TI  - Transcription of the uvrD gene of Escherichia coli is controlled by the lexA 
      repressor and by attenuation.
PG  - 8625-40
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the control region and the presumptive N-terminal 
      portion of the uvrD gene of Escherichia coli K-12 has been determined. The 1190 
      base pairs of DNA examined include the likely coding sequence for the first 258 
      amino acids of the uvrD protein. The transcription promoter for the uvrD gene was 
      identified upstream of the protein coding region. Synthesis of messenger RNA in 
      vitro from this promoter was inhibited by purified lexA protein. The lexA protein 
      was found to bind downstream from the promoter at a sequence, CTGTATATATACCCAG, 
      which is homologous to other known lexA protein binding sites. In the absence of 
      the lexA protein, approximately half of the messages initiated in vitro at the 
      uvrD promoter terminate after about 60 nucleotides at a sequence which resembles 
      a rho-independent terminator. These results indicate that the uvrD gene is 
      induced during the SOS response, and that the expression of the gene may also be 
      regulated by transcription attenuation.

TI  - Transcription of the sulA gene and repression by LexA.
PG  - 337-43
AB  - The Escherichia coli sulA gene product is a highly unstable protein, whose 
      synthesis in response to DNA damage is associated with an inhibition of 
      septation. Genetic evidence as well as sequence information suggests that the 
      sulA gene is part of the E. coli SOS system and is induced after DNA damage. We 
      have constructed a plasmid carrying only the sulA gene; this plasmid is stable 
      only when it contains an amber mutation in the sulA structural gene. Using 
      fragments of this plasmid, we have carried out in vitro transcription experiments 
      and demonstrated one major start site for RNA transcription. We have mapped this 
      initiation point to an adenylate residue 30 nucleotides before the protein start. 
      Purified LexA protein completely abolishes this transcription, in agreement with 
      the prediction made from the genetic and sequence information previously 
      available.

TI  - Regulation of the rpsU-dnaG-rpoD macromolecular synthesis operon and the 
      initiation of DNA replication in Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 48-57
AB  - We have fused the E. coli dnaG 5' regulatory region to the TcR structural gene in 
      the promoter probe plasmids pPV33 and pKK175-6 to demonstrate that a promoter 
      activity is located on a 250 bp SacII-HindIII restriction fragment and that a 
      transcription terminator, previously reported by nucleotide sequence (Smiley et 
      al. 1982) to immediately precede the dnaG gene, acts as such in vivo. We have 
      determined the complete nucleotide sequence of this controlling region and 
      report: 1) tandem promoters on the same SacII-HindIII restriction fragment which 
      promotes tet expression in the gene fusion experiments, 2) an open reading frame 
      between these promoters and the dnaG gene which is the rpsU (ribosomal protein 
      S21) gene, 3) a sequence homologous to the lambda nut site, 4) a possible LexA 
      protein binding site on one of the dnaG promoters. This places the order on the 
      E. coli genetic map at 66 min in the clockwise direction as rpsU-dnaG-rpoD which 
      are all contained in a single macromolecular synthesis operon. We postulate a 
      model for regulation of the initiation of DNA replication based on 
      antitermination of the rpsU-dnaG-rpoD operon.

TI  - The uvrB gene of Escherichia coli has both lexA-repressed and lexA-independent 
      promoters.
PG  - 523-30
AB  - We have found that the uvrB gene of Escherichia coli is transcribed from at least 
      two promoters, which we call P1 and P2. Transcription from P1 begins with an ATP 
      at +1, and transcription from P2 begins primarily with a GTP at -31. A binding 
      site for the lexA protein (LEXA), located between the -35 sequence and Pribnow 
      box of P2, regulates transcription from this promoter. In vitro, LEXA inhibits 
      transcription from P2 but has no detectable effect on transcription from P1. A 
      third promoter, P3, was also detected at -341; transcription from P3 is toward 
      uvrB but terminates in vitro in the region of the LEXA binding site. The binding 
      of LEXA to P2 inhibits transcription from the P3 promoter even though several 
      hundred nucleotides separate the two promoters. The data suggest that a 
      transcribing RNA polymerase stalls when it reaches the repressor-operator complex 
      but remains bound to the DNA, causing a jamming of RNA polymerases between P3 and 
      the repressor-operator complex at P2. The physiological significance of P3 is 
      unknown.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the lexA gene of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 4149-61
AB  - A number of E. coli genes exhibit increased expression when the cellular DNA is 
      damaged. In undamaged cells, lexA repressor limits the extent of their 
      transcription, whereas, in damaged cells, the repressor is cleaved by a cellular 
      protease, the product of the recA gene. We have sequenced 943 base pairs of 
      cloned E. coli DNA containing the lexA gene. A regulatory region has been 
      identified, followed by a translational open reading frame which encodes a 
      polypeptide of 202 amino acids with a molecular weight of 22,300. The protein 
      contains a single alanyl-glycyl peptide near its middle. This peptide is also 
      found in certain phage repressors which are cleaved by the recA protease and has 
      been shown to be the site of cleavage in these repressors. We have determined the 
      nucleotide sequence of a portion of the lexA3 gene, whose product is 100-fold 
      less susceptible to recA protease than the wild type repressor. We report a 
      single base change (G to A) which alters the unique alanine-glycine sequence to 
      alanine-aspartic acid.

TI  - Mechanism of action of the lexA gene product.
PG  - 4204-8
AB  - Genetic experiments have suggested that the lexA gene product of Escherichia coli 
      represses a number of genes involved in the response to DNA damage, including 
      recA and lexA. We purified the lexA gene product from bacterial strains that bear 
      plasmids that direct the synthesis of large amounts of the protein. Purified lexA 
      protein bound to two symmetrical DNA sequences in front of lexA and one in front 
      of recA, protecting them from digestion with DNase I and blocking methylation of 
      purines in the major groove. lexA protein repressed transcription of both genes 
      in vitro. lexA protein binds to the two sites in front of the lexA gene with 
      approximately the same affinity and with greater affinity to the single site in 
      front of the recA gene. The affinity of lexA protein for its operator sites was 
      measured under conditions that mimic conditions in vivo. Differences in the 
      affinity with which lexA protein binds to the operators of genes it represses may 
      account for the differences in the timing and extent of their induction after DNA 
      damage.

TI  - Purified lexA protein is a repressor of the recA and lexA genes.
PG  - 4199-203
AB  - Escherichia coli shows a pleiotropic response (the SOS response) to treatments 
      that damage DNA or inhibit DNA replication. Previous evidence has suggested that 
      the product of the lexA gene is involved in regulating the SOS response, perhaps 
      as a repressor, and that it is sensitive to the recA protease. We show here that 
      lexA protein is a repressor of at least two genes, recA and lexA. Purified 
      protein bound specifically to the regulatory regions of the two genes, as judged 
      by DNase I protection experiments, and it specifically inhibited in vitro 
      transcription of both genes. The binding sites in recA and lexA were found to be 
      about 20 base pairs (bp) and 40 bp long, respectively. The 40-bp sequence in lexA 
      was composed of two adjacent 20-bp sequences, which had considerable homology to 
      one another and to the corresponding recA sequence. These 20-bp sequences, which 
      we term "SOS boxes," show considerable inverted repeat structure as well. These 
      features suggest that each box represents a single repressor binding site. 
      Finally, we found that purified lexA protein was a substrate for the recA 
      protease in a reaction requiring ATP or an analogue, adenosine 
      5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, and denatured DNA.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the lexA gene of E. coli.
PG  - 689-97
AB  - Using a cloned fragment containing the lexA gene of E. coli, the entire 
      nucleotide sequence of the lexA gene has been determined. The probable coding 
      region of the lexA gene contains 606 nucleotide residues and encodes a single 
      protein of 202 amino acids. The initiation site of in vitro transcription of the 
      lexA messenger RNA has been determined by analysis of the 5' nucleotide sequence. 
      Comparison of the DNA sequence of the promoter region of the lexA gene with that 
      of the recA gene reveals the presence of sequences that are common to both. There 
      is some similarity between the amino acid sequences of the lexA and the lambda 
      repressor proteins.

TI  - Organization of the lexA gene of Escherichia coli and nucleotide sequence of the 
      regulatory region.
PG  - 529-43
AB  - The product of the lexA gene of Escherichia coli has been shown to regulate 
      expression of the several cellular functions (SOS functions) induced by 
      treatments which abruptly inhibit DNA synthesis. We have cloned and mapped the 
      lexA gene on a small segment of approximately 600 base pairs. The lexA promotor 
      was located by transcription R-loop analysis, and the lexA product of 22,000 
      daltons was identified by protein synthesis in vitro. An unknown gene was found 
      which directed the synthesis of a protein of 35,000 daltons in a region 
      downstream from the lexA gene. Nucleotide sequence of the regulatory region of 
      the lexA gene was determined. The sequence contained inverted repeats homologous 
      to that of the recA regulatory region. These inverted repeats may be recognized 
      by the lexA protein, because the protein is considered to repress both the genes 
      as a common repressor.

TI  - Identification of the lexA gene product of Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 6147-51
AB  - The Escherichia coli lexA gene encodes a product important in induction of the 
      recA gene and the expression of various cellular functions, including mutagenesis 
      and prophage induction. As a start in a biochemical analysis of the lexA 
      function, a family of lambda transducing phages carrying lexA+, lexA3, lexA3 
      spr-54, and lexA3 spr-55 alleles of the lexA gene was isolated and characterized. 
      Polypeptides synthesized by these phages were examined. lambdalexA+ made a 
      distinctive protein 24 kilodaltons (kd) in size. Lambda lexA3, which encodes an 
      active mutant form of the protein dominant to wild-type function, made a slightly 
      larger protein 25 kd in size. The latter protein was shown to be the mutant lexA3 
      gene product by the fact that lambda lexA3 spr-55, which carries an amber 
      mutation in lexA3, made the 25-kd protein in hosts with an amber suppressor but 
      not in a suppressor-free host. In hosts carrying a multicopy lexA3 plasmid, 
      neither the 25-kd nor the 24-kd protein was made. This result suggests that lexA 
      is autoregulated and that expression of the 24-kd protein made by lambda lexA+ is 
      subject to the same controls. This and other evidence argues that the 24-kd 
      protein is the product of the wild-type lexA+ gene.
