AB  - Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to conduct single-molecule imaging of 
      protein/DNA complexes involved in the regulation of the arabinose operon of 
      Escherichia coli. In the presence of arabinose, the transcription regulatory 
      protein AraC binds to a 38 bp region consisting of the araI1 and araI2 
      half-sites. The domain positioning of full-length AraC, when bound to DNA, was 
      not previously known. In this study, AraC was combined with 302 and 560 bp DNA 
      and arabinose, deposited on a mica substrate, and imaged with AFM in air. High 
      resolution images of 560 bp DNA, where bound protein was visible, showed that 
      AraC induces a bend in the DNA with an angle 60° ± 12° with a median of 55°. 
      These results are consistent with earlier gel electrophoresis measurements that 
      measured the DNA bend angle based on migration rates. By using known domain 
      structures of AraC, geometric constraints, and contacts determined from 
      biochemical experiments, we developed a model of the tertiary and quaternary 
      structure of DNA-bound AraC in the presence of arabinose. The DNA bend angle 
      predicted by the model is in agreement with the measurement values. We discuss 
      the results in view of other regulatory proteins that cause DNA bending and 
      formation of the open complex to initiate transcription.

TI  - Arabinose Alters Both Local and Distal H-D Exchange Rates in the Escherichia coli 
      AraC Transcriptional Regulator.
PG  - 2875-2882
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.9b00389 [doi]
AB  - In the absence of arabinose, the dimeric Escherichia coli regulatory protein of 
      the l-arabinose operon, AraC, represses expression by looping the DNA between 
      distant half-sites. Binding of arabinose to the dimerization domains forces AraC 
      to preferentially bind two adjacent DNA half-sites, which stimulates RNA 
      polymerase transcription of the araBAD catabolism genes. Prior genetic and 
      biochemical studies hypothesized that arabinose allosterically induces a 
      helix-coil transition of a linker between the dimerization and DNA binding 
      domains that switches the AraC conformation to an inducing state [Brown, M. J., 
      and Schleif, R. F. (2019) Biochemistry, preceding paper in this issue (DOI: 
      10.1021/acs.biochem.9b00234)]. To test this hypothesis, hydrogen-deuterium 
      exchange mass spectrometry was utilized to identify structural regions involved 
      in the conformational activation of AraC by arabinose. Comparison of the 
      hydrogen-deuterium exchange kinetics of individual dimeric dimerization domains 
      and the full-length dimeric AraC protein in the presence and absence of arabinose 
      reveals a prominent arabinose-induced destabilization of the amide 
      hydrogen-bonded structure of linker residues (I(167) and N(168)). This 
      destabilization is demonstrated to result from an increased probability to form a 
      helix capping motif at the C-terminal end of the dimerizing α-helix of the 
      dimerization domain that preceeds the interdomain linker. These conformational 
      changes could allow for quaternary repositioning of the DNA binding domains 
      required for induction of the araBAD promoter through rotation of peptide 
      backbone dihedral angles of just a couple of residues. Subtle changes in exchange 
      rates are also visible around the arabinose binding pocket and in the DNA binding 
      domain.

TI  - Development of a new fluorescent reporter:operator system: location of AraC 
      regulated genes in Escherichia coli K-12.
PG  - 170

AB  - BACKGROUND: In bacteria, many transcription activator and repressor proteins 
      regulate multiple transcription units that are often distally distributed on the 
      bacterial genome. To investigate the subcellular location of DNA bound proteins 
      in the folded bacterial nucleoid, fluorescent reporters have been developed which 
      can be targeted to specific DNA operator sites. Such Fluorescent 
      Reporter-Operator System (FROS) probes consist of a fluorescent protein fused to 
      a DNA binding protein, which binds to an array of DNA operator sites located 
      within the genome. Here we have developed a new FROS probe using the Escherichia 
      coli MalI transcription factor, fused to mCherry fluorescent protein. We have 
      used this in combination with a LacI repressor::GFP protein based FROS probe to 
      assess the cellular location of commonly regulated transcription units that are 
      distal on the Escherichia coli genome. RESULTS: We developed a new DNA binding 
      fluorescent reporter, consisting of the Escherichia coli MalI protein fused to 
      the mCherry fluorescent protein. This was used in combination with a Lac 
      repressor:green fluorescent protein fusion to examine the spatial positioning and 
      possible co-localisation of target genes, regulated by the Escherichia coli AraC 
      protein. We report that induction of gene expression with arabinose does not 
      result in co-localisation of AraC-regulated transcription units. However, 
      measurable repositioning was observed when gene expression was induced at the 
      AraC-regulated promoter controlling expression of the araFGH genes, located close 
      to the DNA replication terminus on the chromosome. Moreover, in dividing cells, 
      arabinose-induced expression at the araFGH locus enhanced chromosome segregation 
      after replication. CONCLUSION: Regions of the chromosome regulated by AraC do not 
      colocalise, but transcription events can induce movement of chromosome loci in 
      bacteria and our observations suggest a role for gene expression in chromosome 
      segregation.

TI  - A genetic and physical study of the interdomain linker of E. Coli AraC protein--a 
      trans-subunit communication pathway.
PG  - 448-60
LID - 10.1002/prot.24990 [doi]
AB  - Genetic experiments with full length AraC and biophysical experiments with its 
      dimerization domain plus linker suggest that arabinose binding to the 
      dimerization domain changes the properties of the inter-domain linker which 
      connects the dimerization domain to the DNA binding domain via interactions that 
      do not depend on the DNA binding domain. Normal AraC function was found to 
      tolerate considerable linker sequence alteration excepting proline substitutions. 
      The proline substitutions partially activate transcription even in the absence of 
      arabinose and hint that a structural shift between helix and coil may be 
      involved. To permit fluorescence anisotropy measurements that could detect 
      arabinose-dependent dynamic differences in the linkers, IAEDANS was conjugated to 
      a cysteine residue substituted at the end of the linker of dimerization domain. 
      Arabinose, but not other sugars, decreased the steady-state anisotropy, 
      indicating either an increase in mobility and/or an increase in the fluorescence 
      lifetime of the IAEDANS. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements showed that the 
      arabinose-induced anisotropy decrease did not result from an increase in the 
      excited-state lifetime. Hence arabinose-induced decreases in anisotropy appear to 
      result from increased tumbling of the fluorophore. Arabinose did not decrease the 
      anisotropy in mutants incapable of binding arabinose nor did it alter the 
      anisotropy when IAEDANS was conjugated elsewhere in the dimerization domain. 
      Experiments with heterodimers of the dimerization domain showed that the binding 
      of arabinose to one subunit of the dimer decreases the fluorescence anisotropy of 
      only a fluorophore on the linker of the other subunit.

TI  - Genome-scale analyses of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica AraC reveal 
      noncanonical targets and an expanded core regulon.
PG  - 660-71
LID - 10.1128/JB.01007-13 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli AraC is a well-described transcription activator of genes 
      involved in arabinose metabolism. Using complementary genomic approaches, 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip, and transcription profiling, we 
      identify direct regulatory targets of AraC, including five novel target genes: 
      ytfQ, ydeN, ydeM, ygeA, and polB. Strikingly, only ytfQ has an established 
      connection to arabinose metabolism, suggesting that AraC has a broader function 
      than previously described. We demonstrate arabinose-dependent repression of ydeNM 
      by AraC, in contrast to the well-described arabinose-dependent activation of 
      other target genes. We also demonstrate unexpected read-through of transcription 
      at the Rho-independent terminators downstream of araD and araE, leading to 
      significant increases in the expression of polB and ygeA, respectively. AraC is 
      highly conserved in the related species Salmonella enterica. We use ChIP 
      sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to map the AraC regulon in S. 
      enterica. A comparison of the E. coli and S. enterica AraC regulons, coupled with 
      a bioinformatic analysis of other related species, reveals a conserved regulatory 
      network across the family Enterobacteriaceae comprised of 10 genes associated 
      with arabinose transport and metabolism.

TI  - Understanding the basis of a class of paradoxical mutations in AraC through 
      simulations.
PG  - 490-8
LID - 10.1002/prot.24207 [doi]
AB  - Most mutations at position 15 in the N-terminal arm of the regulatory protein 
      AraC leave the protein incapable of responding to arabinose and inducing the 
      proteins required for arabinose catabolism. Mutations at other positions of the 
      arm do not have this behavior. Simple energetic analysis of the interactions 
      between the arm and bound arabinose do not explain the uninducibility of AraC 
      with mutations at position 15. Extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, 
      carried out largely on the Open Science Grid, were done of the wild-type protein 
      with and without bound arabinose and of all possible mutations at position 15, 
      many of which were constructed and measured for this work. Good correlation was 
      found for deviation of arm position during the simulations and inducibility as 
      measured in vivo of the same mutant proteins. Analysis of the MD trajectories 
      revealed that preservation of the shape of the arm is critical to inducibility. 
      To maintain the correct shape of the arm, the strengths of three interactions 
      observed to be strong in simulations of the wild-type AraC protein need to be 
      preserved. These interactions are between arabinose and residue 15, arabinose and 
      residues 8-9, and residue 13 and residue 15. The latter interaction is notable 
      because residues L9, Y13, F15, W95, and Y97 form a hydrophobic cluster which 
      needs to be preserved for retention of the correct shape.

AB  - An interaction between the dimerization domains and DNA binding domains of the 
      dimeric AraC protein has previously been shown to facilitate repression of the 
      Escherichia coli araBAD operon by AraC in the absence of arabinose. A new 
      interaction between the domains of AraC in the presence of arabinose is reported 
      here, the regulatory consequences of which are unknown. Evidence for the 
      interaction is the following: the dissociation rate of arabinose-bound AraC from 
      half-site DNA is considerably faster than that of free DNA binding domain, and 
      the affinity of the dimerization domains for arabinose is increased when 
      half-site DNA is bound. In addition, an increase in the fluorescence intensity of 
      tryptophan residues located in the arabinose-bound dimerization domain is 
      observed upon binding of half-site DNA to the DNA binding domains. Direct 
      physical evidence of the new domain-domain interaction is demonstrated by 
      chemical crosslinking and NMR experiments.

TI  - Active role of the interdomain linker of AraC.
PG  - 5737-46
LID - 10.1128/JB.05339-11 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the interdomain linker of the gene for the AraC regulatory protein 
      of Escherichia coli that severely interfere with the protein's ability either to 
      repress or to activate transcription have been found. These mutations have 
      relatively small effects on the dimerization domain's ability to bind arabinose 
      or to dimerize the protein or on the DNA-binding domain's affinity for a single 
      DNA half-site. The linker mutations, however, dramatically change the affinity of 
      AraC for binding to two direct-repeat DNA half-sites. Less dramatically, the 
      induction-deficient linker variants also display altered DNA sequence 
      selectivity. These results show that changing the sequence of the interdomain 
      linker can profoundly affect the dimerization domain-DNA-binding domain 
      interactions in AraC. The smaller effects on the functions of the individual 
      domains could be the direct result of the linker alterations but more likely are 
      the indirect result of the altered dimerization domain-DNA-binding domain 
      interactions. In summary, the linker does not simply function as a passive and 
      flexible connector between the domains of AraC but, instead, is more directly 
      involved in the protein's dimerization domain-DNA-binding domain interactions.

TI  - Negative auto-regulation increases the input dynamic-range of the arabinose 
      system of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 111
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-5-111 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gene regulation networks are made of recurring regulatory patterns, 
      called network motifs. One of the most common network motifs is negative 
      auto-regulation, in which a transcription factor represses its own production. 
      Negative auto-regulation has several potential functions: it can shorten the 
      response time (time to reach halfway to steady-state), stabilize expression 
      against noise, and linearize the gene's input-output response curve. This latter 
      function of negative auto-regulation, which increases the range of input signals 
      over which downstream genes respond, has been studied by theory and synthetic 
      gene circuits. Here we ask whether negative auto-regulation preserves this 
      function also in the context of a natural system, where it is embedded within 
      many additional interactions. To address this, we studied the negative 
      auto-regulation motif in the arabinose utilization system of Escherichia coli, in 
      which negative auto-regulation is part of a complex regulatory network. RESULTS: 
      We find that when negative auto-regulation is disrupted by placing the regulator 
      araC under constitutive expression, the input dynamic range of the arabinose 
      system is reduced by 10-fold. The apparent Hill coefficient of the induction 
      curve changes from about n = 1 with negative auto-regulation, to about n = 2 when 
      it is disrupted. We present a mathematical model that describes how negative 
      auto-regulation can increase input dynamic-range, by coupling the transcription 
      factor protein level to the input signal. CONCLUSIONS: Here we demonstrate that 
      the negative auto-regulation motif in the native arabinose system of Escherichia 
      coli increases the range of arabinose signals over which the system can respond. 
      In this way, negative auto-regulation may help to increase the input 
      dynamic-range while maintaining the specificity of cooperative regulatory 
      systems. This function may contribute to explaining the common occurrence of 
      negative auto-regulation in biological systems.

PG  - 1524-32
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01970-09 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria such as Escherichia coli will often consume one sugar at a time when fed 
      multiple sugars, in a process known as carbon catabolite repression. The classic 
      example involves glucose and lactose, where E. coli will first consume glucose, 
      and only when it has consumed all of the glucose will it begin to consume 
      lactose. In addition to that of lactose, glucose also represses the consumption 
      of many other sugars, including arabinose and xylose. In this work, we 
      characterized a second hierarchy in E. coli, that between arabinose and xylose. 
      We show that, when grown in a mixture of the two pentoses, E. coli will consume 
      arabinose before it consumes xylose. Consistent with a mechanism involving 
      catabolite repression, the expression of the xylose metabolic genes is repressed 
      in the presence of arabinose. We found that this repression is AraC dependent and 
      involves a mechanism where arabinose-bound AraC binds to the xylose promoters and 
      represses gene expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that sugar 
      utilization in E. coli involves multiple layers of regulation, where cells will 
      consume first glucose, then arabinose, and finally xylose. These results may be 
      pertinent in the metabolic engineering of E. coli strains capable of producing 
      chemical and biofuels from mixtures of hexose and pentose sugars derived from 
      plant biomass.

TI  - A DNA-assisted binding assay for weak protein-protein interactions.
PG  - 805-14
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2009.09.064 [doi]
AB  - We describe a new method used for quantitating weak interactions between proteins 
      in which the weak interaction is "assisted" by a known DNA-DNA interaction. 
      Oligonucleotides, which are conjugated to proteins of interest, contain short 
      complementary DNA sequences that provide additional binding energy for 
      protein-protein interactions. A stretch of unpaired bases links the protein to 
      the hybridizing DNA sequence to allow formation of both protein-protein and 
      DNA-DNA interactions with minimal structural interference. We validated the 
      DNA-assisted binding method using heterodimerizing coiled-coil proteins. The 
      method was then used to measure the predicted weak interaction between two 
      domains of the Escherichia coli L-arabinose operon regulatory protein AraC. The 
      interaction between domains has the expected magnitude (K(d)=0.37 mM) in the 
      absence of arabinose. Upon addition of arabinose, we detected a weaker and 
      unexpected interaction, which may necessitate modification of the proposed 
      mechanism of AraC. The DNA-assisted binding method may also prove useful in the 
      study of other weak protein-protein interactions.

AB  - We report the solution structure of the DNA binding domain of the Escherichia 
      coli regulatory protein AraC determined in the absence of DNA. The 20 lowest 
      energy structures, determined on the basis of 1507 unambiguous nuclear Overhauser 
      restraints and 180 angle restraints, are well resolved with a pair wise backbone 
      root mean square deviation of 0.7 A. The protein, free of DNA, is well folded in 
      solution and contains seven helices arranged in two semi-independent sub domains, 
      each containing one helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif, joined by a 19 residue 
      central helix. This solution structure is discussed in the context of extensive 
      biochemical and physiological data on AraC and with respect to the DNA-bound 
      structures of the MarA and Rob homologs.

TI  - Functional modes of the regulatory arm of AraC.
PG  - 81-91
LID - 10.1002/prot.22137 [doi]
AB  - One of the two crystal structures of the arm-dimerization domain determined in 
      the absence of arbinose fails to show the arm, whereas the other structure does 
      show it. The two structures lead to different pictures for the regulatory 
      behavior of the arms. Trypsin digestion, fluorescence anisotropy, and NMR 
      experiments presented here were designed to resolve the issue and show that in 
      arm-dimerization domain, the arms are structured, although differently, in the 
      presence and absence of arabinose. The arms have also been shown to interact with 
      the DNA binding domains of AraC by their requirement for the immobilization of 
      the DNA binding domains that is necessary for DNA looping and repression. The 
      binding of arabinose has been shown to release the DNA binding domains and 
      looping ceases. The picture resulting from the new experiments and the crystal 
      structures of the arm-dimerization domain is that in the absence of arabinose, 
      the arm adopts one structure on the dimerization domain and that the DNA binding 
      domain then binds to this complex. Upon binding arabinose, the arm restructures 
      and as a result, no longer serves as a gasket between the DNA binding domain and 
      dimerization domain. The DNA binding domain is then released, subject only to the 
      constraints imposed by the flexible linker connecting it to dimerization domain, 
      and the protein relocates on the DNA and activates transcription.

TI  - Structure and properties of a truely apo form of AraC dimerization domain.
PG  - 646-54
AB  - The arabinose-binding pockets of wild type AraC dimerization domains crystallized 
      in the absence of arabinose are occupied with the side chains of Y31 from 
      neighboring domains. This interaction leads to aggregation at high solution 
      concentrations and prevents determination of the structure of truely apo AraC. In 
      this work we found that the aggregation does not significantly occur at 
      physiological concentrations of AraC. We also found that the Y31V mutation 
      eliminates the self-association, but does not affect regulation properties of the 
      protein. At the same time, the mutation allows crystallization of the 
      dimerization domain of the protein with only solvent in the arabinose-binding 
      pocket. Using a distance difference method suitable for detecting and displaying 
      even minor structural variation among large groups of similar structures, we find 
      that there is no significant structural change in the core of monomers of the 
      AraC dimerization domain resulting from arabinose, fucose, or tyrosine occupancy 
      of the ligand-binding pocket. A slight change is observed in the relative 
      orientation of monomers in the dimeric form of the domain upon the binding of 
      arabinose but its significance cannot yet be assessed.

TI  - Mutational analysis of residue roles in AraC function.
PG  - 85-93
AB  - The previously isolated hemiplegic, induction-negative, repression-positive 
      mutants, H80R and Y82C, were found to be defective in the binding of arabinose. 
      Randomization of other residues close to arabinose in the three-dimensional 
      structure of AraC or that make strong interactions with arabinose yielded 
      induction-negative, repression-positive mutants. The induction and repression 
      properties of mutants obtained by randomizing individual residues of the 
      N-terminal arm of AraC allowed identification of the domain with which that 
      residue very likely makes its predominant interactions. Residues 8-14 of the arm 
      appear to make their predominant interaction with the DNA-binding domain. 
      Although the side-chain of residue 15 interacts directly with arabinose bound to 
      the N-terminal dimerization domain, the properties of mutant F15L indicate that 
      this mutation increases the affinity of the arm for the DNA-binding domain.

TI  - Cooperative action of the catabolite activator protein and AraC in vitro at the 
      araFGH promoter.
PG  - 1995-2000
AB  - Full activation of transcription of the araFGH promoter, p(FGH), requires both 
      the catabolite activator protein (CAP) and AraC protein. At p(FGH), the binding 
      site for CAP is centered at position -41.5, an essential binding site for AraC is 
      centered at position -79.5, and a second, nonessential binding site is centered 
      at position -154.5. In this work, we used the minimal promoter region required 
      for in vivo activation of p(FGH) to examine the roles of CAP and AraC in 
      stimulating formation of open complexes at p(FGH). Migration retardation assays 
      of open complexes showed that RNA polymerase binds exceptionally tightly to the 
      AraC-CAP-p(FGH) complex and that the order of addition of proteins to the 
      initiating complex is important. Similar assays with RNA polymerase containing 
      truncated alpha subunits suggest that AraC interacts with the C-terminal domain 
      of the alpha subunit. Finally, AraC protein also acts to prevent the improper 
      binding of RNA polymerase at a pseudo promoter near the true p(FGH) promoter.

TI  - Apo-AraC actively seeks to loop.
PG  - 529-38
AB  - In the absence of arabinose and interactions with other proteins, AraC, the 
      activator-repressor that regulates the araBAD operon in Escherichia coli, was 
      found to prefer participating in DNA looping interactions between the two 
      well-separated DNA half-sites, araI1 and araO2 at their normal separation of 211 
      base-pairs rather than binding to these same two half-sites when they are 
      adjacent to one another. On the addition of arabinose, AraC preferred to bind to 
      the adjacently located half-sites. Inverting the distally located araO2 half-site 
      eliminated the looping preference. These results demonstrate that apo-AraC 
      possesses an intrinsic looping preference that is eliminated by the presence of 
      arabinose. We developed a method for the accurate determination of the relative 
      affinities of AraC for the DNA half-sites araI1, araI2, and araO2 and 
      non-specific DNA. These affinities allowed accurate calculation of basal level 
      and induced levels of expression from pBAD under a wide variety of natural and 
      mutant conditions. The calculations independently predicted the looping 
      preference of apo-AraC.

TI  - Arac/XylS family of transcriptional regulators.
PG  - 393-410
AB  - The ArC/XylS family of prokaryotic positive transcriptional regulators includes 
      more than 100 proteins and polypeptides derived from open reading frames 
      translated from DNA sequences. Members of this family are widely distributed and 
      have been found in the gamma subgroup of the proteobacteria, low- and high-G + 
      C-content gram-positive bacteria, and cyanobacteria. These proteins are defined 
      by a profile that can be accessed from PROSITE PS01124. Members of the family are 
      about 300 amino acids long and have three main regulatory functions in common: 
      carbon metabolism, stress response, and pathogenesis. Multiple alignments of the 
      proteins of the family define a conserved stretch of 99 amino acids usually 
      located at the C-terminal region of the regulator and connected to a nonconserved 
      region via a linker. The conserved stretch contains all the elements required to 
      bind DNA target sequences and to activate transcription from cognate promoters. 
      Secondary analysis of the conserved region suggests that it contains two 
      potential alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix DNA binding motifs. The first, and 
      better-fitting motif is supported by biochemical data, whereas existing 
      biochemical data neither support nor refute the proposal that the second region 
      possesses this structure. The phylogenetic relationship suggests that members of 
      the family have recruited the nonconserved domain(s) into a series of existing 
      domains involved in DNA recognition and transcription stimulation and that this 
      recruited domain governs the role that the regulator carries out. For some 
      regulators, it has been demonstrated that the nonconserved region contains the 
      dimerization domain. For the regulators involved in carbon metabolism, the 
      effector binding determinants are also in this region. Most regulators belonging 
      to the AraC/XylS family recognize multiple binding sites in the regulated 
      promoters. One of the motifs usually overlaps or is adjacent to the -35 region of 
      the cognate promoters. Footprinting assays have suggested that these regulators 
      protect a stretch of up to 20 bp in the target promoters, and multiple alignments 
      of binding sites for a number of regulators have shown that the proteins 
      recognize short motifs within the protected region.

TI  - The 1.6 A crystal structure of the AraC sugar-binding and dimerization domain 
      complexed with D-fucose.
PG  - 226-37
AB  - The crystal structure of the sugar-binding and dimerization domain of the 
      Escherichia coli gene regulatory protein, AraC, has been determined in complex 
      with the competitive inhibitor D-fucose at pH 5.5 to a resolution of 1.6 A. An 
      in-depth analysis shows that the structural basis for AraC carbohydrate 
      specificity arises from the precise arrangement of hydrogen bond-forming protein 
      side-chains around the bound sugar molecule. van der Waals interactions also 
      contribute to the epimeric and anomeric selectivity of the protein. The methyl 
      group of D-fucose is accommodated by small side-chain movements in the 
      sugar-binding site that result in a slight distortion in the positioning of the 
      amino-terminal arm. A comparison of this structure with the 1.5 A structure of 
      AraC complexed with L-arabinose at neutral pH surprisingly revealed very small 
      structural changes between the two complexes. Based on solution data, we suspect 
      that the low pH used to crystallize the fucose complex affected the structure, 
      and speculate about the nature of the changes between pH 5.5 and neutral pH and 
      their implications for gene regulation by AraC. A comparison with the 
      structurally unrelated E. coli periplasmic sugar-binding proteins reveals that 
      conserved features of carbohydrate recognition are present, despite a complete 
      lack of structural similarity between the two classes of proteins, suggesting 
      convergent evolution of carbohydrate binding.

TI  - Structural basis for ligand-regulated oligomerization of AraC.
PG  - 421-5
AB  - The crystal structure of the arabinose-binding and dimerization domain of the 
      Escherchia coli gene regulatory protein AraC was determined in the presence and 
      absence of L-arabinose. The 1.5 angstrom structure of the arabinose-bound 
      molecule shows that the protein adopts an unusual fold, binding sugar within a 
      beta barrel and completely burying the arabinose with the amino-terminal arm of 
      the protein. Dimer contacts in the presence of arabinose are mediated by an 
      antiparallel coiled-coil. In the 2.8 angstrom structure of the uncomplexed 
      protein, the amino-terminal arm is disordered, uncovering the sugar-binding 
      pocket and allowing it to serve as an oligomerization interface. The ligand-gated 
      oligomerization as seen in AraC provides the basis of a plausible mechanism for 
      modulating the protein's DNA-looping properties.

TI  - How AraC interacts specifically with its target DNAs.
PG  - 667-74
AB  - Previous work indicates that one subunit of the AraC protein dimer binds to a DNA 
      target araI1, of 17 base-pairs. We systematically substituted every base-pair in 
      a synthetic araI1 target with the three possible alternatives and then tested 
      binding of araI1 and of these 51 DNA targets to AraC by quantitative gel shift 
      analysis in the presence of L-arabinose. We found that every substitution of the 
      underlined bases reduces AraC binding tenfold or more: 5' TAGCATTTTTATCCATA 3'. 
      Substitutions at other bases have little or no effect. In the absence of 
      L-arabinose we observed a sixfold reduction of binding of AraC to araI1. We have 
      designated the 5' AGC sequence the A-box and the 5'TCCATA sequence the B-box. We 
      synthesised DNA targets containing either two A or two B-boxes with the natural 
      araI1-I2 spacing. Wild-type AraC binds both targets in the presence of 
      L-arabinose in a gel shift-experiment. In the absence of L-arabinose, AraC binds 
      only to the double B-box. We then tested various AraC mutant proteins in the same 
      way. S208A and H212A bind to the double B-box but not to the double A-box in the 
      presence or absence of L-arabinose. D256A binds to the double A-box, but not to 
      the double B-box, in the presence of L-arabinose but not in its absence. The 
      implications of these results for the mechanism of AraC induction by L-arabinose 
      are discussed.

TI  - In vivo induction kinetics of the arabinose promoters in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 3438-42
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the AraC protein represses transcription from its own 
      promoter, PC, and when associated with arabinose, activates transcription from 
      three other promoters, PBAD, PE, and PFGH. Expression from all four of these 
      promoters is also regulated by cyclic AMP-catabolite activator protein; however, 
      the arrangement of the protein binding sites is not identical for each promoter. 
      We are interested in determining how the AraC protein is able to activate PBAD, 
      PE, and PFGH despite their differences. We have characterized the induction 
      response of the wild-type arabinose operons from their native chromosomal 
      locations by primer extension analysis. In this analysis, mRNA from the four 
      arabinose operons plus an internal standard could all be assayed in the RNA 
      obtained from a single sample of cells. We found that each of the operons shows a 
      rapid, within 15 to 30 s, response to arabinose. We also found that the 
      expression of araFGH is more sensitive to catabolite repression but not to 
      arabinose concentration than are araE and araBAD. Finally, we have determined the 
      relative levels of inducibility in wild-type cells of araBAD, araFGH, and araE to 
      be 6.5, 5, and 1, respectively. These results provide a basis for subsequent 
      studies to determine the mechanism(s) by which AraC protein activates 
      transcription from the different arabinose promoters.

TI  - Functional domains of the AraC protein.
PG  - 5638-42
AB  - The AraC protein, which regulates the L-arabinose operons in Escherichia coli, 
      was dissected into two domains that function in chimeric proteins. One provides a 
      dimerization capability and binds the ligand arabinose, and the other provides a 
      site-specific DNA-binding capability and activates transcription. In vivo and in 
      vitro experiments showed that a fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal half 
      of the AraC protein and the DNA-binding domain of the LexA repressor dimerizes, 
      binds well to a LexA operator, and represses expression of a LexA 
      operator-beta-galactosidase fusion gene in an arabinose-responsive manner. In 
      vivo and in vitro experiments also showed that a fusion protein consisting of the 
      C-terminal half of the AraC protein and the leucine zipper dimerization domain 
      from the C/EBP transcriptional activator binds to araI and activates 
      transcription from a PBAD promoter-beta-galactosidase fusion gene. Dimerization 
      was necessary for occupancy and activation of the wild-type AraC binding site.

TI  - AraC protein can activate transcription from only one position and when pointed 
      in only one direction.
PG  - 205-18
AB  - At the araBAD promoter, the RNA polymerase-proximal half-site for AraC binding 
      partially overlaps the -35 region. Random and explicit spacing experiments show 
      that both this partial overlapping and AraC binding to the polymerase-proximal 
      half-site are necessary and sufficient for strong transcriptional activation. 
      Normally, this occupancy is generated by the presence of arabinose, which shifts 
      AraC from a DNA looping interaction involving the polymerase-distal half-site and 
      the araO2 site 210 base-pairs away, to an interaction with the two half-sites 
      adjacent to RNA polymerase. Changing the polymerase-proximal half-site to a 
      higher affinity AraC binding site gives activation in the absence of arabinose. 
      Thus, arabinose is not required to transform AraC into an activating 
      conformation. Because the two half-sites of araI are direct repeats, the RNA 
      polymerase proximal and distal surfaces of AraC are not identical. When the araI 
      site was turned around, no spacings were found from which AraC could activate 
      transcription. In light of the strict spacing and orientation requirements for 
      AraC activation, the interactions between AraC and RNA polymerase are likely to 
      be specific and inflexible.

TI  - The XylS/AraC family of regulators.
PG  - 807-10
AB  - At least twenty-seven proteins belong to the XylS/AraC family of prokaryote 
      transcriptional regulators. All members of this family except CelD and TetD are 
      positive transcriptional factors. Three subgroups were distinguished within the 
      family in accordance with the Needleman and Wunsch algorithm. Multiple alignment 
      of these proteins revealed that they shared a high degree of sequence homology at 
      their C-terminal end, where a characteristic conserved motif, whose consensus 
      sequence is I-DIA--GF-S--YF--F---G-TPS--R (where - means any aminoacid), was 
      found. Within the homologous C-terminal region, but outside the above consensus 
      motif, a putative DNA-binding domain organized as a helix-turn-helix motif was 
      located in all regulators. For regulators recognizing chemical signals, the 
      non-homologous N-terminal region of these regulators is presumed to contain 
      binding sites for activator molecules that confer specificity.

TI  - Variation of half-site organization and DNA looping by AraC protein.
PG  - 35-44
AB  - The dimeric AraC protein of Escherichia coli binds specifically to DNA sequences 
      upstream of promoters whose transcription is regulated by arabinose. Here we show 
      with affinity measurements, DNase footprinting, dimethyl sulfate premethylation 
      interference and dimethyl sulfate footprinting studies that AraC protein can 
      recognize paired half-sites in direct repeat orientation or inverted repeat 
      orientation. A similar high degree of flexibility was also seen in the ability of 
      the protein in the absence of arabinose to bind tightly and specifically when the 
      separation of its half-sites was increased by 10 or 21 bp. In the presence of 
      arabinose the protein could specifically contact both half-sites of a +10 bp 
      spacing construct but could not contact both in a +21 bp construct. Reduced 
      extensibility of AraC protein in the presence of arabinose provides a simple 
      mechanism for the protein's shift from a non-inducing, DNA looping state to an 
      inducing, non-looping state that contacts two adjacent half-sites at the arapBAD 
      promoter.

TI  - AraC protein contacts asymmetric sites in the Escherichia coli araFGH promoter.
PG  - 24848-57
AB  - AraC protein regulates the transcription of arabinose transport and catabolic 
      operons in Escherichia coli through interaction with specific DNA sequences in 
      the promoter regions of the operons. The interaction of AraC protein with two 
      binding sites in the araFGH promoter was determined and compared to previously 
      studied AraC binding sites in the araBAD promoter. Methylation and ethylation 
      interference assays show that AraC protein binds along one side of the DNA to 
      four adjacent major groove regions at each of the araFG1 and araFG2 sites. 
      Mutations within any of the four regions of araFG1 greatly reduce protein binding 
      in vitro. The promoter function in vivo is also greatly reduced, indicating that 
      all four regions of the binding site are required. The chemical interference and 
      genetic data, combined with the consensus sequence for AraC protein binding to 
      ara promoters, support a binding motif in which two directly repeated units each 
      span two adjacent turns of the DNA helix. The function of the two AraC binding 
      sites was also examined. The proximal araFG1 site is required for promoter 
      activation, whereas the distal araFG2 site has only a slight effect on the 
      promoter activity.

TI  - Sequence elements in the Escherichia coli araFGH promoter.
PG  - 6862-71
AB  - The Escherichia coli araFGH operon codes for proteins involved in the L-arabinose 
      high-affinity transport system. Transcriptional regulation of the operon was 
      studied by creating point mutations and deletions in the control region cloned 
      into a GalK expression vector. The transcription start site was confirmed by RNA 
      sequencing of transcripts. The sequences essential for polymerase function were 
      localized by deletions and point mutations. Surprisingly, only a weak -10 
      consensus sequence, and no -35 sequence is required. Mutation of a guanosine at 
      position -12 greatly reduced promoter activity, which suggests important 
      polymerase interactions with DNA between the usual -10 and -35 positions. A 
      double mutation toward the consensus in the -10 region was required to create a 
      promoter capable of significant AraC-independent transcription. These results 
      show that the araFGH promoter structure is similar to that of the galP1 promoter 
      and is substantially different from that of the araBAD promoter. The effects of 
      11 mutations within the DNA region thought to bind the cyclic AMP receptor 
      protein correlate well with the CRP consensus binding sequence and confirm that 
      this region is responsible for cyclic AMP regulation. Deletion of the AraC 
      binding site nearest the promoter, araFG1, eliminates arabinose regulation, 
      whereas deletion of the upstream AraC binding site, araFG2, has only a slight 
      effect on promoter activity.

TI  - Repression of the araBAD promoter from araO1.
PG  - 335-41
AB  - DNA looping between the araO2 and araI sites holds the uninduced or basal level 
      of expression of the araBAD genes from the pBAD promoter at a low level. Despite 
      the presence of another and closer site potentially capable of mediating looping 
      to araI, no repression from this site, called araO1, is observed. Here we show, 
      using both in vivo and in vitro experiments, that the araO1 site is not normally 
      occupied by AraC protein under repressing conditions, but that if AraC protein is 
      overproduced and the araO2 site is absent, araO1 is then occupied and repression 
      of pBAD can be observed.

TI  - Mapping, sequence, and apparent lack of function of araJ, a gene of the 
      Escherichia coli arabinose regulon.
PG  - 7765-71
AB  - We report the mapping, sequencing, and study of the physiological role of the 
      fourth arabinose-inducible operon from Escherichia coli, araJ. It is located at 9 
      min on the chromosome and codes for a single 42-kDa protein that shows no 
      significant homology to other known proteins. Destruction of the chromosomal araJ 
      gene does not detectably affect either of the two arabinose transport systems, 
      the ability of cells to grow on arabinose, or the induction kinetics of the 
      araBAD operon, and thus the physiological role of AraJ, if any, remains unknown. 
      We have also found a long open reading frame upstream of araJ. The sequence of 
      this upstream open reading frame was found to be identical to the previously 
      reported sequence of the sbcC gene (I. S. Naom, S. J. Morton, D. R. F. Leach, and 
      R. G. Lloyd, Nucleic Acids Res. 17:8033-8044, 1989). The carboxyl region of SbcC 
      has an amino acid sequence consistent with this region of SbcC forming an 
      extended alpha-helical coiled-coil.

TI  - AraC-DNA looping: orientation and distance-dependent loop breaking by the cyclic 
      AMP receptor protein.
PG  - 45-54
AB  - The arabinose operon promoter, pBAD, is negatively regulated in the absence of 
      arabinose by AraC protein, which forms a DNA loop by binding to two sites 
      separated by 210 base-pairs, araO2 and araI1. pBAD is also positively regulated 
      by AraC-arabinose and the cyclic AMP receptor protein, CRP. We provide evidence 
      that CRP breaks the araO2-araI1 repression loop in vitro. The ability of CRP to 
      break the loop in vitro and to activate pBAD in vivo is dependent upon the 
      orientation and distance of the CRP binding site relative to araI1. An insertion 
      of one DNA helical turn, 11 base-pairs, between CRP and araI only partially 
      inhibits CRP loop breaking and activation of pBAD, while an insertion of less 
      than one DNA helical turn, 4 base-pairs, not only abolishes CRP activation and 
      loop breaking, but actually causes CRP to stabilize the loop and increases the 
      araO2-mediated repression of pBAD. Both integral and non-integral insertions of 
      greater than one helical turn completely abolish CRP activation and loop breaking 
      in vitro.

TI  - DNA looping and unlooping by AraC protein.
PG  - 528-32
AB  - Expression of the L-arabinose BAD operon in Escherichia coli is regulated by AraC 
      protein which acts both positively in the presence of arabinose to induce 
      transcription and negatively in the absence of arabinose to repress 
      transcription. The repression of the araBAD promoter is mediated by DNA looping 
      between AraC protein bound at two sites near the promoter separated by 210 base 
      pairs, araI and araO2. In vivo and in vitro experiments presented here show that 
      an AraC dimer, with binding to half of araI and to araO2, maintains the repressed 
      state of the operon. The addition of arabinose, which induces the operon, breaks 
      the loop, and shifts the interactions from the distal araO2 site to the 
      previously unoccupied half of the araI site. The conversion between the two 
      states does not require additional binding of AraC protein and appears to be 
      driven largely by properties of the protein rather than being specified by the 
      slightly different DNA sequences of the binding sites. Slight reorientation of 
      the subunits of AraC could specify looping or unlooping by the protein. Such a 
      mechanism could account for regulation of DNA looping in other systems.

TI  - Characterization of the Escherichia coli araFGH and araJ promoters.
PG  - 497-510
AB  - The identities of two cloned, arabinose-inducible promoters were tested by 
      hybridizing promoter DNA fragments with restriction digests of chromosomal DNA 
      containing Mudlac phage inserted in either araFGH or in araE transport operons. 
      One promoter, thought to be araE, is within 10(3) base-pairs of a Mudlac 
      insertion in the araE gene. The second promoter was not found within several 
      thousand base-pairs of either of the known transport genes. This promoter is now 
      named araPJ (araJ). The DNA sequence of the fragment containing the araFGH 
      promoter was determined. The start site of transcription in vivo was located to 
      within +/- 1 base-pair (bp) by S1 nuclease mapping. DNase 1 footprinting revealed 
      that, in comparison with the araBAD and araE promoters, the locations of the AraC 
      and cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) binding sites are reversed with CRP lying 
      between AraC and RNA polymerase. The central location of the CRP binding site may 
      explain why the araFGH promoter is more catabolite sensitive than the other ara 
      promoters. AraC and CRP were both required for maximal transcription in vitro, 
      although a low level of transcription was detected with CRP alone. S1 nuclease 
      mapping of mRNA-DNA hybrids from the araJ promoter located the transcription 
      start point to within #/- 3 bp, and demonstrates that the promoter is dependent 
      upon AraC protein and CRP in vivo. DNase footprinting showed that the location of 
      the AraC protein binding site on araJ is adjacent to the RNA polymerase site, as 
      seen at the araBAD and araE promoters. Two CRP sites were observed; one is 
      upstream from the AraC site and one is downstream from the transcription start 
      site.

TI  - In vivo DNA loops in araCBAD: size limits and helical repeat.
PG  - 476-80
AB  - Formation of a DNA loop by AraC proteins bound at the araI and araO2 sites, whose 
      center-to-center distance is 211 base pairs, is necessary for repression of the 
      araBAD promoter, PBAD, of Escherichia coli. To determine the upper and lower size 
      limits of the loop, we constructed PBAD-reporter gene fusion plasmids with 
      various spacings between araI and araO2 and measured their levels of expression. 
      Spacings larger than about 500 base pairs resulted in elimination of detectable 
      repression. No lower limit to spacing was found, suggesting that AraC protein 
      itself possesses significant flexibility and its bending substantially aids 
      formation of small loops. As the spacing between araI and araO2 varied, the 
      activity of PBAD oscillated with an 11.1-base-pair periodicity, implying that the 
      in vivo helical repeat of this DNA is 11.1 base pairs per turn.

TI  - Alternative DNA loops regulate the arabinose operon in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 5444-8
AB  - The araCBAD regulatory region of Escherichia coli contains two divergently 
      oriented promoters and three sites to which AraC, the regulatory protein of the 
      operon, can bind. This paper presents the results of in vivo dimethyl sulfate 
      "footprinting" experiments to monitor occupancy of the three AraC sites and 
      measurements of activity of the two promoters. These measurements were made both 
      in the absence of the inducer arabinose and at various times after arabinose 
      addition to growing cells containing the wild-type ara regulatory region or the 
      regulatory region containing various deletions and point mutations. The data lead 
      to the conclusion that two different DNA loops can form in the ara regulatory 
      region. These loops are generated by AraC protein molecules binding to two 
      different DNA sites and binding to each other. One of these loops predominates in 
      the absence of arabinose and plays a major role in repressing activity of one of 
      the promoters. Upon the addition of arabinose the amount of the first loop type, 
      the repression loop, decreases and the amount of a second loop increases. 
      Formation of this second loop precludes the counterproductive formation of the 
      repression loop.

TI  - Three binding sites for AraC protein are required for autoregulation of araC in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1749-53
AB  - Three binding sites for AraC protein were shown to be required for the 
      autoregulation of araC: araI1, araO1, and araO2. Selective inactivation of 
      AraC-binding sites on the DNA demonstrated that araO1 and araO2 are required in 
      vivo to produce repression of araC in the presence of arabinose, whereas araI1 
      and araO2 are required in its absence. We found that the low-affinity site araO2 
      is essential for araC autoregulation; araO1 and araI1 provide high-affinity 
      AraC-binding sites, which allow cooperative binding at araO2. Profound effects on 
      the araBAD promoter and the araC promoter are produced by ligand-induced changes 
      in AraC occupancy of functional sites on the DNA. We suggest that AraC exerts its 
      multiplicity of controls through two alternative states of cooperative 
      interactions with DNA and we illustrate this with a model. This model presents 
      our interpretations of activation and repression of the araBAD operon and the 
      autoregulation of the araC gene.

TI  - Arabinose-induced binding of AraC protein to araI2 activates the araBAD operon 
      promoter.
PG  - 8814-8
AB  - The state of Escherichia coli araI DNA occupancy by AraC protein has been found 
      to change from a two-turn to a four-turn occupancy upon the addition of the 
      inducer arabinose. The araI site is separable into two contiguous regions, araI1 
      and araI2. araI1 binds both ligand-bound and ligand-free AraC protein, whereas 
      araI2 binds AraC protein in the presence of arabinose only. A mutation in araI 
      and a known mutation in araC led to the loss of araI2 binding, while binding to 
      araI1 was unaffected. Both mutants failed to activate the promoter of the araBAD 
      operon. We propose that araI2 occupancy by AraC protein leads to RNA polymerase 
      recognition of the araBAD promoter and that araI1 acts as a switch mechanism 
      allowing both the repressor and the activator forms of AraC protein to regulate 
      the araBAD promoter.

TI  - The DNA loop model for ara repression: AraC protein occupies the proposed loop 
      sites in vivo and repression-negative mutations lie in these same sites.
PG  - 3654-8
AB  - Two sets of experiments have been performed to test the DNA loop model of 
      repression of the araBAD operon of Escherichia coli. First, dimethyl sulfate 
      methylation protection measurements on normally growing cells show that the AraC 
      regulatory protein occupies the araI site in the presence and absence of the 
      inducer arabinose. Similarly, the araO2 site is shown to be occupied by AraC 
      protein in the presence and absence of arabinose; however, its occupancy by AraC 
      is greatly reduced when araI and adjacent sequences are deleted. Thus, AraC 
      protein binds to araO2 cooperatively with some other component of the ara system 
      located at least 60 base pairs away. Second, the mutational analysis presented 
      here shows that the DNA components required for repression of araBAD are araI, 
      araO2, and perhaps the araBAD operon RNA polymerase binding site.

TI  - Regulation of the araC gene of Escherichia coli: catabolite repression, 
      autoregulation, and effect on araBAD expression.
PG  - 4120-4
AB  - The araC gene encodes a positive regulatory protein required for L-arabinose 
      utilization in Escherichia coli. Transcription from the araC promoter has been 
      shown to be under positive control by cAMP receptor protein and under negative 
      control by its protein product (autoregulation). This work describes the 
      identification of the region of the araC promoter that interacts with the cAMP 
      receptor protein to mediate catabolite repression. A 3-base-pair deletion 
      centered 60 base pairs from the transcriptional initiation site results in a 
      mutant araC promoter that, in the absence of araC protein, reduces 
      transcriptional activity when compared with the wild-type promoter and is 
      unresponsive to various concentrations of intracellular cAMP in vivo. The same 
      deletion results in a lowered affinity of the araC promoter for cAMP receptor 
      protein in vitro. However, this lowered affinity for the mutant araC promoter 
      does not result in substantial reduction of intracellular araC protein because 
      autoregulation of the araC gene dominates catabolite repression. The 3-base-pair 
      deletion in the cAMP receptor protein binding site of the araC promoter does not 
      affect catabolite repression of the adjacent araBAD operon. The implications of 
      these results on current models for expression of the araBAD operon and the araC 
      gene are discussed.

AB  - The promoter for the gene encoding the low affinity L-arabinose uptake protein in 
      Escherichia coli was studied. The promoter was cloned, sequenced, its 
      transcription start site determined by S1 nuclease mapping, the proteins required 
      for in vitro transcription were determined, and the regulatory protein binding 
      sites located by DNase footprinting. The araE promoter shows no evidence of an 
      operator site upstream from the CRP binding site, but otherwise it is similar to 
      the araBAD promoter.

TI  - Mechanism of araC autoregulation and the domains of two overlapping promoters, Pc 
      and PBAD, in the L-arabinose regulatory region of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 752-6
AB  - The DNA-protein contact sites in the ara regulatory region, which contains the 
      promoters for araBAD and araC, have been determined for araC protein, the cyclic 
      AMP-binding protein, and RNA polymerase, by using the methylation protection and 
      DNase I protection methods. The functional significance of binding was assessed 
      by correlating the state of occupancy of these sites with promoter activity in 
      transcription initiation. Our results suggest that the basis for araC 
      autoregulation is that araC protein, in either its activator (P2) or repressor 
      (P1) form, acts as a repressor for araC, by binding to the RNA polymerase 
      attachment site at the araC promoter. We also found that the araC and araBAD 
      promoters share a common site of positive control by the cyclic AMP-binding 
      protein, located 90 bases from the araBAD and 60 bases from the araC 
      transcriptional start points. A model for the mechanism of regulation of araBAD 
      and araC expression by the catabolite gene-activator protein, P1, and Pe is 
      proposed. An earlier model proposed by Ogden et al. [Ogden S., Haggerty, D., 
      Stoner, C. M., Kolodrubetz, D. & Schleif, R. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 
      77, 3346-3350] is discussed in the light of the data presented in this paper.
