## Core Concepts

### Concept 1: Foundation

Let's start with the basics. [Explain the first fundamental concept in clear, accessible language.]

**Key Points:**

- Point 1: Explanation
- Point 2: Explanation  
- Point 3: Explanation

::: {.callout-tip}
## Think of it this way

Use an analogy or real-world example to make the concept more relatable.

For example: "Think of this like organizing your closet - you need a system to find things quickly."

:::

### Concept 2: Building Blocks

Now that you understand [Concept 1], let's build on that foundation.

```python
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false

# Example demonstrating Concept 2
def example_function():
    """
    This function demonstrates the concept.
    """
    result = "Hello from Concept 2!"
    return result

# Try it out
print(example_function())
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Code Explanation

Let's break down what this code does:

1. **Line 1-2**: Define the function
2. **Line 3-5**: Docstring explaining purpose
3. **Line 6-7**: Implementation
4. **Line 10**: Calling the function

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Installation

Follow these steps to get started:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Windows

1. Download the installer from [official website]
2. Run the installer with administrator privileges
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Verify installation:

```bash
command --version
```

## macOS

1. Install using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install package-name
```

2. Verify installation:

```bash
command --version
```

## Linux

1. Use your package manager:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install package-name

# Fedora
sudo dnf install package-name
```

2. Verify installation:

```bash
command --version
```

:::

### Verification

Let's make sure everything is working:

```python
#| eval: false

# Test your installation
import package_name

print(package_name.__version__)
print("✓ Installation successful!")
```

Expected output:

```
1.0.0
✓ Installation successful!
```

::: {.callout-success}
## Success!

If you see this output, you're ready to proceed!

## Your First Project

Let's create a simple project to practice what you've learned.

### Step 1: Project Setup

Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir my-first-project
cd my-first-project
```

### Step 2: Create Main File

Create a file called `main.py`:

```python
#| filename: "main.py"
#| eval: false

"""
My First Project
A simple program demonstrating core concepts.
"""

def main():
    """Main function."""
    print("Hello, Course!")
    print("This is my first project.")
    
    # Add your code here
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 3: Run Your Project

```bash
python main.py
```

::: {.callout-important}
## Checkpoint

Before moving on, make sure:

- [ ] Your environment is set up correctly
- [ ] You can run the example code
- [ ] You understand the core concepts
- [ ] You've completed the setup exercise

## Practice Exercise

::: {.exercise-box}
### Exercise 1.1: Hello World Plus

**Objective**: Modify the starter code to add personalization.

**Task**:
1. Modify `main.py` to accept a name as input
2. Print a personalized greeting
3. Add a timestamp to the output

**Starter Code**:

```python
#| eval: false

def greet(name):
    # Your code here
    pass

def main():
    # Your code here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Expected Output**:

```
Hello, Alice!
Welcome to the course.
Current time: 2025-01-05 10:30:00
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint

Use Python's `input()` function to get the name and `datetime` module for timestamps.

:::

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
## Solution

```python
from datetime import datetime

def greet(name):
    """Return a personalized greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!\nWelcome to the course."

def main():
    """Main function."""
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    greeting = greet(name)
    print(greeting)
    print(f"Current time: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
